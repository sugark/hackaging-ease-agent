      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents the fastest growing underlying cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been shown to impact immune effector cell function. The standard of care for the treatment of advanced HCC is immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, yet NASH may negatively affect the efficacy of ICI therapy in HCC. The immunologic mechanisms underlying the impact of NASH on ICI therapy remain unclear. Herein, using multiple murine NASH models, we analysed the influence of NASH on the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dependent anti-PD-1 responses against liver cancer. We characterised CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells' transcriptomic, functional, and motility changes in mice receiving a normal diet (ND) or a NASH diet. NASH blunted the effect of anti-PD-1 therapy against liver cancers in multiple murine models. NASH caused a proinflammatory phenotypic change of hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed changes related to NASH-dependent impairment of hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell metabolism. In vivo imaging analysis showed reduced motility of intratumoural CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Metformin treatment rescued the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy against liver tumours in NASH. We discovered that CD8+ T-cell metabolism is critically altered in the context of NASH-related liver cancer, impacting the effectiveness of ICI therapy - a finding which has therapeutic implications in patients with NASH-related liver cancer. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis represents the fastest growing cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also associated with reduced efficacy of immunotherapy, which is the standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we show that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is associated with impaired motility, metabolic function, and response to anti-PD-1 treatment in hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can be rescued by metformin treatment.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal carcinogenesis coincides with immune cell dysfunction. Metformin has been reported to play a role in stimulating antitumor immunity, suggesting it could be used to overcome immunosuppression in colorectal cancer. Herein, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we showed that metformin remodels the immune landscape of colorectal cancer. In particular, metformin treatment expanded the proportion of CD8+ T cells and potentiated their function. Analysis of the metabolic activities of cells in the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) at a single-cell resolution demonstrated that metformin reprogrammed tryptophan metabolism, which was reduced in colorectal cancer cells and increased in CD8+ T cells. Untreated colorectal cancer cells outcompeted CD8+ T cells for tryptophan, leading to impaired CD8+ T-cell function. Metformin in turn reduced tryptophan uptake by colorectal cancer cells, thereby restoring tryptophan availability for CD8+ T cells and increasing their cytotoxicity. Metformin inhibited tryptophan uptake in colorectal cancer cells by downregulating MYC, which led to a reduction in the tryptophan transporter SLC7A5. This work highlights metformin as an essential regulator of T-cell antitumor immunity by reprogramming tryptophan metabolism, suggesting it could be a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for treating colorectal cancer. Analysis of the impact of metformin on the colorectal cancer immunometabolic landscape at a single-cell resolution shows that metformin alters cancer cell tryptophan metabolism to stimulate CD8+ T-cell antitumor activity.",

      "abstract": "Despite their revolutionary success in cancer treatment over the last decades, immunotherapies encounter limitations in certain tumor types and patients. The efficacy of immunotherapies depends on tumor antigen-specific CD8 T-cell viability and functionality within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, where oxygen levels are often low. Hypoxia can reduce CD8 T-cell fitness in several ways and CD8 T cells are mostly excluded from hypoxic tumor regions. Given the challenges to achieve durable reduction of hypoxia in the clinic, ameliorating CD8 T-cell survival and effector function in hypoxic condition could improve tumor response to immunotherapies. Activated CD8 T cells were exposed to hypoxia and metformin and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for cell proliferation, apoptosis and phenotype. In vivo, metformin was administered to mice bearing hypoxic tumors and receiving either adoptive cell therapy with tumor-specific CD8 T cells, or immune checkpoint inhibitors; tumor growth was followed over time and CD8 T-cell infiltration, survival and localization in normoxic or hypoxic tumor regions were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Tumor oxygenation and hypoxia were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance and pimonidazole staining, respectively. We found that the antidiabetic drug metformin directly improved CD8 T-cell fitness in hypoxia, both in vitro and in vivo. Metformin rescued murine and human CD8 T cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and increased their proliferation and cytokine production, while blunting the upregulation of programmed cell death protein 1 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3. This appeared to result from a reduced production of reactive oxygen species, due to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. Differently from what others reported, metformin did not reduce tumor hypoxia, but rather increased CD8 T-cell infiltration and survival in hypoxic tumor areas, and synergized with cyclophosphamide to enhance tumor response to adoptive cell therapy or immune checkpoint blockade in different tumor models. This study describes a novel mechanism of action of metformin and presents a promising strategy to achieve immune rejection in hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumors, which would otherwise be resistant to immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Metformin may offer benefits to certain cancer populations experiencing metabolic abnormalities. To extend the anticancer studies of metformin, a tumor model was established through the implantation of murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells to Normal Diet (ND)-fed and High-Fat Diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. The HFD-fed mice displayed metabolic and pro-inflammatory alterations together with accompanying aggressive tumor growth. Metformin mitigated tumor growth in HFD-fed mice, paralleled by reductions in circulating glucose, insulin, soluble P-selectin, TGF-β1 and High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1), as well as tumor expression of cell proliferation, aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, platelets and neutrophils molecules. The suppressive effects of metformin on cell proliferation, migration and oncogenic signaling molecules were confirmed in cell study. Moreover, tumor-bearing HFD-fed mice had higher contents of circulating and tumor immunopositivity of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs)-associated molecules, with a suppressive effect from metformin. Data taken from neutrophil studies confirmed the inhibitory effect that metformin has on NET formation induced by HMGB1. Furthermore, HMGB1 was identified as a promoting molecule to boost the transition process towards NETs. The current study shows that metabolic, pro-inflammatory and NET alterations appear to play roles in the obesity-driven aggressiveness of cancer, while also representing candidate targets for anticancer potential of metformin.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC. We retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin's impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin's effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin's effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models. Metformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024). Metformin may improve lung cancer-specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin's anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.",

      "abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy of metformin in prostate cancer (PCa) appears uncertain based on various clinical trials. Metformin treatment failure may be attributed to the high frequency of transcriptional dysregulation, which leads to drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found evidences that metformin resistance in PCa cells may be linked to cell cycle reactivation. Super-enhancers (SEs), crucial regulatory elements, have been shown to be associated with drug resistance in various cancers. Our analysis of SEs in metformin-resistant (MetR) PCa cells revealed a correlation with Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (PTGR1) expression, which was identified as significantly increased in a cluster of cells with metformin resistance through single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Our functional experiments showed that PTGR1 overexpression accelerated cell cycle progression by promoting progression from the G0/G1 to the S and G2/M phases, resulting in reduced sensitivity to metformin. Additionally, we identified key transcription factors that significantly increase PTGR1 expression, such as SRF and RUNX3, providing potential new targets to address metformin resistance in PCa. In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the cellular mechanism underlying metformin resistance and the regulation of the SE-TFs-PTGR1 axis, offering potential avenues to enhance metformin's therapeutic efficacy in PCa.",

      "abstract": "Metformin and aspirin are commonly co-prescribed to people with diabetes. Metformin may prevent cancer, but in older people (over 70 years), aspirin has been found to increase cancer mortality. This study examined whether metformin reduces cancer mortality and incidence in older people with diabetes; it used randomization to 100 mg aspirin or placebo in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to quantify aspirin's impact on metformin users. Analysis included community-dwelling ASPREE participants (aged ≥70 years, or ≥65 years for members of US minority populations) with diabetes. Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level greater than 125 mg/dL, self-report of diabetes, or antidiabetic medication use. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the association of metformin and a metformin-aspirin interaction with cancer incidence and mortality, with adjustment for confounders. Of 2045 participants with diabetes at enrollment, 965 were concurrently using metformin. Metformin was associated with a reduced cancer incidence risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51 to 0.90), but no conclusive benefit for cancer mortality (adjusted HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.43 to 1.19). Metformin users randomized to aspirin had greater risk of cancer mortality compared with placebo (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.18 to 5.43), but no effect was seen for cancer incidence (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.64). The possible effect modification of aspirin on cancer mortality, however, was not statistically significant (interaction P = .11). In community-dwelling older adults with diabetes, metformin use was associated with reduced cancer incidence. Increased cancer mortality risk in metformin users randomized to aspirin warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01038583.",

Although these regimens produce better clinical results, the vast majority of patients still suffer from disease recurrence or primary drug resistance. Metformin has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, whether it can synergize with venetoclax and the underlying mechanisms of metformin-induced apoptosis are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of metformin and venetoclax on the growth of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. In both Molm13 and THP-1 cell lines, metformin and venetoclax synergistically inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of leukaemia cells. Most importantly, the combination of metformin and venetoclax treatment significantly increased the expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related marker CHOP, for example, in AML cell lines. Knockdown of CHOP markedly attenuated the metformin- and venetoclax-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, the combination of metformin and venetoclax demonstrated prominent anti-leukaemia effects in xenograft models and bone marrow samples from AML patients. In summary, the combination of metformin and venetoclax showed enhanced anti-leukaemia activity with acceptable safety in AML patients, representing a new combinatorial strategy worth further clinical investigation to treat AML.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high malignancy, strong invasiveness, and a propensity for distant metastasis, leading to poor prognosis and relatively limited treatment options. Metformin, as a first-line oral hypoglycemic agent, has garnered widespread research interest in recent years due to its potential in cancer prevention and treatment. However, its efficacy varies significantly across different tumor types. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as SAHA, have demonstrated antitumor activity, but TNBC responds poorly to HDACi monotherapy, possibly due to feedback activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Exploring the synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms of combining metformin with HDACi in TNBC treatment is crucial. We predicted the synergistic effects of metformin and SAHA in TNBC using multiple computational methods (CMap, DTsyn, and DrugComb). We also developed a cancer-specific compound mimic library (CDTSL) and applied a three-step strategy to identify genes fitting the \"metformin sensitization\" model. Subsequently, we evaluated the synergistic effects of metformin and SAHA in TNBC cell lines through cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the combined treatment using techniques such as transcriptome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Western blotting, and measurement of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Additionally, we assessed the in vivo antitumor effects of the combined therapy in a nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model. CMap, DTsyn, and DrugComb all predicted the synergistic effects of SAHA and metformin in TNBC. The screening results revealed that HDAC10 played a key role in metformin sensitization. We found that the combination of metformin and SAHA exhibited synergistic antitumor effects (combination index CI < 0.9) in TNBC cell lines. Mechanistically, metformin inhibited histone acetylation on FGFR4, thereby blocking the feedback activation of FGFR4 downstream pathways induced by SAHA. Furthermore, metformin interfered with the glycolysis process induced by SAHA, altering the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells. In in vivo experiments, the combined treatment of metformin and SAHA significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Metformin enhances the sensitivity of TNBC to HDAC inhibitors by blocking the FGFR4 pathway and interfering with metabolic reprogramming. When used in combination with SAHA, metformin exhibits synergistic antitumor effects. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the combined application of HDAC inhibitors and metformin, potentially offering a new strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",

Quo vadis? Now, researchers aim to move metformin from a non-targeted stage of cancer therapy that has been mostly developed retrospectively and empirically into a targeted therapy by following a biological rationale and a predefined mechanism of action. But, who might benefit from metformin? Cui bono?

Given the significant burden of disease non-melanoma skin cancers represent, the possibility of a widely available and generally well-tolerated medication such as metformin as part of the prevention and treatment ladder warrants further research. This study aims to evaluate the potential of metformin in reducing the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, specifically squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, using the All of Us research database. A retrospective case-control analysis was conducted using the All of Us database. Propensity score matching and multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of metformin on the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) while controlling for confounding variables. Our results indicate a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancer following exposure to metformin in individuals diagnosed with both SCC and BCC. Subgroup analyses revealed that metformin exposure was associated with a decreased risk of BCC across all sex and ethnicity groups. Metformin use was also associated with a significantly lower risk of SCC, with univariable and multivariable ORs consistently showing reduced odds. However, metformin exposure was not significantly associated with decreased SCC risk in African American patients. Our study's findings indicate a potential protective effect of metformin against skin cancer, particularly in patients with skin of color. Further prospective research is necessary to substantiate metformin's role in skin cancer chemoprevention within these populations.J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(12):1089-1095. doi:10.36849/JDD.8249.",

We investigated the effect of obesity on pancreatic carcinogenesis in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-Kras<sup>G12D+/-</sup> (KC) mice. Metformin was administrated to rescue the effects of obesity and NETs. The pro-tumorigenic effects of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were further evaluated in vivo and vitro. We found that obesity significantly promoted the progression of murine pancreatic ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanIN). The proliferation rate and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of mPanIN ductal cells were increased in obese mice. More visceral adipocytes, PD-L1<sup>+</sup> neutrophil infiltration and NETs formation were found in the pancreas of obese mice and visceral adipocytes could recruit neutrophils and promote NETs formation. The latter could induce an inflammatory response in ductal cells via TLR4-dependent pathways both in vivo and vitro, as demonstrated by upregulation of IL-1β. Metformin and DNase I significantly reversed the pro-tumorigenic effects of obesity and NETs in vivo and in vitro. Our study provides causal evidence for the contribution of obesity in promoting pancreatic carcinogenesis in genetic model and reveals the mechanism by NETs to regulate mPanIN progression.",

Ferroptosis, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-reliant cell death, can enhance cellular immunogenicity and then active immune system. To sustain a long-term \"hot\" tumour immune microenvironment (TIME), an immune-modulator is indispensable. Metformin (MET), a commonly used oral drug for type 2 diabetes, has played a vital role in fostering an immunostimulatory environment. Herein, we confirm the TIME can be remodeled by MET and further promotes ferroptosis via upregulating cellular concentration of l-Glutamine. In light of this, we have design a self-assembled MET-loaded Fe<sup>3+</sup>-doped polydopamine nanoparticle (Fe-PDA-MET NP) that can disorder the cellular redox homeostasis and induce robust ferroptosis under 808 nm irradiation, resulting in a strong immune response. Based on the function of MET, there is a marked increase in the infiltration of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells, which subsequently augments ferroptosis to a greater extent. Taken together, Fe-PDA-MET NPs activate a ferroptotic positive-feedback loop for effectively control TNBC progression, which offers a promising therapeutic modality to enhance the immunogenicity and reshape the TIME.",

      "abstract": "Head and neck cancers represent a significant portion of cancer diagnoses, with head and neck cancer incidence increasing in some parts of the world. Typical treatment of early-stage head and neck cancers includes either surgery or radiotherapy; however, advanced cases often require surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Salivary gland damage following radiotherapy leads to severe and chronic hypofunction with decreased salivary output, xerostomia, impaired ability to chew and swallow, increased risk of developing oral mucositis, and malnutrition. There is currently no standard of care for radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction, and treatment is often limited to palliative treatment that provides only temporary relief. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that activates catabolic processes and has been shown to influence the cell cycle, proliferation, and autophagy. In the present study, we found that radiation (IR) treatment decreases tissue levels of phosphorylated AMPK following radiation and decreases intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and AMP while increasing intracellular adenosine triphosphate. Furthermore, expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) was lower 5 d following IR. Treatment with AMPK activators, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) and metformin, attenuated compensatory proliferation (days 6, 7, and 30) following IR and reversed chronic (day 30) salivary gland dysfunction post-IR. In addition, treatment with metformin or AICAR increased markers of apical/basolateral polarity (phosphorylated aPKCζ<sup>T560</sup>-positive area) and differentiation (amylase-positive area) within irradiated parotid glands to levels similar to untreated controls. Taken together, these data suggest that AMPK may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of radiation-induced salivary damage.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive endocrine disease characterized by metabolic abnormalities, with 34-70% of patients with PCOS also presenting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Metformin is a first-line treatment for relieving insulin resistance in PCOS; however, the potential therapeutic application of metformin for preventing NAFLD/metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in PCOS remains under-explored. Here, we investigated the potential protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of metformin against hepatic lipid metabolic disorders in prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone (PAMH)-induced PCOS mice. <b>Methods:</b> First, we developed a prenatal AMH-induced PCOS-like model using pregnant C57BL/6N mice. Female offspring of mice were then subjected to the glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test pre- and post-treatment with metformin. H&E staining, serum hormone, and biochemical analyses were performed to determine the effects of metformin on metabolic abnormalities and liver damage in the PCOS-like model. To verify the specific mechanism of action of metformin, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and free fatty acids (FFAs; palmitic acid and oleic acid) induced alpha mouse liver 12 (AML-12) cells were used to establish a mouse liver cell model of adipose-like degeneration and lipid deposition. <b>Results:</b> Metformin effectively alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation in the PCOS mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of redox homeostasis in the liver of PCOS mice were rescued upon metformin administration. Mechanistic insights reveal that metformin regulates mitochondrial autophagy in PCOS liver tissue via the activation of the Ethe1/Keap1/Nrf2/PINK1/Parkin pathway, thereby improving liver recovery in PCOS mice. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings highlight the role and mechanism of metformin in ameliorating abnormal mitophagy and lipid metabolic disorders in the PCOS mice livers and the potential of metformin for addressing NAFLD in PCOS mice.",

Tumor hypoxia has prognostic impact and represents a valid, interventional target. This phase II study investigated efficacy of the antidiabetic drug metformin to modify hypoxia according to established biomarkers. Preliminary results including tolerability, safety and feasibility are reported here. Patients were included in a 1:1 randomized, open-label design, comparing standard chemoradiotherapy ± metformin. Metformin 850 mg twice daily was administered 1 week before and during chemoradiotherapy. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline, after 1 week of metformin treatment, and at brachytherapy for biomarker assessments. Tolerability and safety were determined by treatment completion rates and frequency of adverse events (AEs). Safety was further evaluated by possible increase in MRI-based hypoxia during the first week of metformin. Feasibility was determined by proportion of completed study interventions and imaging and biopsy procedures. In total, 18 and 23 patients were allocated to the intervention and control arm, respectively. Eighteen and 15 patients completed metformin treatment for 1 and 5 weeks. Frequency of AEs ≥ grade 3 was not significantly different between study arms. Most AEs were gastrointestinal toxicities. Tumors with increase in hypoxia during the first week were all below the defined safety limit. A total of 98% of scheduled MR series and biopsies were collected with satisfactory quality. Addition of metformin to chemoradiotherapy is tolerable and safe. Serial sampling of MRI and tumor biopsies for hypoxia biomarker assessment is feasible.",

In this article, we examine the impact of diabetes and glucose-lowering treatments on HCC incidence and overall survival (OS). Data from 1064 patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease (CLD) (n = 340) or HCC (n = 724) were collected from 2007 to 2012. Patients with HCC were followed up prospectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression determined HCC risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine survival and Cox proportional hazards analysis estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to use of glucose-lowering therapies. Diabetes prevalence was 39.6% and 10.6% within the HCC and CLD cohorts, respectively. The odds ratio for having HCC in patients with diabetes was 5.55 (P < 0.001). Univariate analysis found an increased association of HCC with age, sex, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and Child's Pugh score. In multivariate analysis age, sex, cirrhosis, Child's Pugh score, diabetes status, and insulin use retained significance. Diabetes status did not significantly affect OS in HCC; however, in people with diabetes and HCC, metformin treatment was associated with improved OS (mean survival, 31 vs 24 months; P =0.016; HR for death = 0.75; P = 0.032). Diabetes is significantly associated with HCC in the United Kingdom. Metformin treatment is associated with improved OS after HCC diagnosis. Treatment of diabetes should be appropriately reviewed in high-risk populations, with specific consideration of the potential hepatoprotective effects of metformin in HCC.",

This study aimed to investigate the influence of metformin on patient survival and its potential correlation with distinct immune profiles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. We included 82 upfront resected and 66 gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT)-treated patients from the PREOPANC randomized controlled trial (RCT). Transcriptomic NanoString immunoprofiling was performed for a subset of 96 available resected specimens. Disparities in survival outcomes and immune profiles were apparent between metformin and non-metformin users in upfront resected patients but lacking in nCRT-treated patients. Compared to non-metformin users, upfront resected metformin users showed a higher median overall survival (OS) of 29 vs 14 months and a better 5-year OS rate of 19% vs 5%. Furthermore, metformin use was a favorable prognostic factor for OS in the upfront surgery group (HR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.99). Transcriptomic data revealed that metformin users significantly underexpressed genes related to pro-tumoral immunity, including monocyte to M2 macrophage polarization and activation. Furthermore, the relative abundance of anti-inflammatory CD163+ MRC1+ M2 macrophages in non-metformin users and immune-activating CD1A+ CD1C+ dendritic cells in metformin users was heightened (P < .001). This study unveils immune profile changes resulting from metformin use in upfront resected pancreatic cancer patients, possibly contributing to prolonged survival outcomes. Specifically, metformin use may decrease the abundance and activity of pro-tumoral M2 macrophages and increase the recruitment and function of tumor-resolving DCs, favoring antitumor immunity.[PREOPANC trial EudraCT: 2012-003181-40].",

Our objective was to employ three statistical methods proven to avoid ITB and compare their results to that of a naïve time-fixed analysis in order to provide further evidence of metformin's association, or none thereof, with colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. A total of 41,533 Korean subjects with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes in 2005-2015 were selected from a prospectively maintained cohort (median follow-up of 6.3 years). Time-to-CRC incidence was regressed upon metformin use (yes/no, average prescription days/year) using time-dependent Cox, landmark, nested case-control, and time-fixed Cox analyses. Other CRC risk factors were included to adjust for possible confounding. Neither metformin ever-use nor average metformin prescription days/year was associated with incident CRC hazard in time-dependent Cox, landmark, and nested case-control analyses with HR (95% CI) of 0.88 (0.68-1.13), 0.86 (0.65-1.12), and 1.10 (0.86-1.40) for metformin ever-use, and 0.97 (0.90-1.04), 0.95 (0.88-1.04), and 1.02 (0.95-1.10) for average metformin prescription days/year, respectively. In contrast, time-fixed Cox regression showed a falsely exaggerated protective effect of metformin on CRC incidence. The association between metformin use and subsequent CRC incidence was statistically nonsignificant after accounting for time-related biases such as ITB. Previous studies that avoided these biases and meta-analyses of RCTs on metformin and cancer incidence were in agreement with our results. A definitive, large-scale RCT is needed to clarify this topic, and future observational studies should be explicit in avoiding ITB and other time-related biases.",

Patients with colorectal cancer and T2DM during 2000-2012 period were identified form Lithuanian Cancer Registry and the National Health Insurance Fund database. Colorectal cancer-specific survival (CS) was the primary outcome. It was measured from date of colorectal cancer diagnosis to date of death due to colorectal cancer, or last known date alive. 15,052 people who met eligibility criteria for this analysis, including 1094 (7.27%) with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (271 metformin never users and 823 metformin users) and 13 958 people without diabetes assessed. During follow-up (mean follow-up time was 4.4 years, with range from 1 day to 17 years) there were 10,927 deaths including 8559 from colorectal cancer. Significantly lower risk in CS between diabetic and non-diabetic people with lower risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.94) in diabetic patient population was seen. After adjustment for age, stage at diagnosis and metformin usage, significant difference in colorectal CS between metformin users in diabetic patient population compared to non-diabetics and metformin non-users in diabetic patient population was found (0.80 (0.72-0.89) vs 1.00 and vs 1.05 (0.91-1.23)). Overall survival (OS) was better for diabetic patients with significant difference in diabetic metformin users (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-0.94).

Surgery stands as the mainstay of treatment of pancreatic cancer but is an option in less than 15% patients owing to the late presentation of the tumor. Chemotherapy offers an important part of treatment but can adversely affect the quality of life because of devastating side effects and has limited survival benefit. Unavailability of effective and less toxic treatment options for pancreatic cancer has prompted the search for new treatment strategies. One such drug being considered for its potential anti-neoplastic role is the time-tested and widely used oral hypoglycemic drug, metformin. Metformin is proposed to target metabolic pathways involved in tumorigenesis, specifically the AMPK-mTOR complex. Epidemiological evidence is mounting in favor of its role in various cancers both for treatment and prophylaxis. Herein, we aim to summarize the epidemiological data on metformin as a potential anti-cancer drug in various cancers followed by a look at some of the abstracts relating to this topic that were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2014.",

However, recent clinical studies suggest increased proliferation and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in a subgroup of patients with breast cancer (BC) after metformin therapy. Considering that FAO can activate Src kinase in aggressive triple-negative BC (TNBC), we postulate that low-dose biguanide-driven AMPK-ACC-FAO signaling may activate the Src pathway in TNBC. The low bioavailability of metformin in TNBC xenografts mimics metformin's in vitro low-dose effect. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FAO significantly enhances the anti-tumor properties of biguanides. Lower doses of biguanides induce and higher doses suppress Src signaling. Dasatinib and metformin synergistically inhibit TNBC patient-derived xenograft growth, but not in high-fat diet-fed mice. This combination also suppresses TNBC metastatic progression. A combination of biguanides with Src inhibitors provides synergy to target metastatic TNBC suffering with limited treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Androgen deprivation is the standard treatment for patients with prostate cancer. However, the disease eventually progresses as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, is a typical drug for treating CRPC and with continuous reliance on the drug, can lead to enzalutamide resistance. This highlights the necessity for developing novel therapeutic targets to combat the gain of resistance. Metformin has been recently investigated for its potential antitumorigenic effects in many cancer types. In this study, we used enzalutamide and metformin in combination to explore the possible rescued efficacy of enzalutamide in the treatment of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. We first tested the effects of this combination treatment on cell viability, drug synergy, and cell proliferation in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cell lines. After combination treatment, we observed a decrease in cell proliferation and viability as well as a synergistic effect of both enzalutamide and metformin in vitro. Following these results, we sought to explore how combination treatment affected mitochondrial fitness using mitochondrial stress test analysis and mitochondrial membrane potential shifts due to metformin's action in inhibiting complex I of oxidative phosphorylation. We employed 2 different strategies for in vivo testing using 22Rv1 and LuCaP35CR xenograft models. Finally, RNA sequencing revealed a potential link in the downregulation of rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling following combination treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative phosphorylation might play a critical role in the development of resistance to cancer therapy. This study showed that targeting oxidative phosphorylation with metformin can enhance the efficacy of enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro.",

      "abstract": "Metformin slows tumor growth and progression in vitro, and in combination with chemoradiotherapy, resulted in high overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in our phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02325401). Metformin is also postulated to activate an antitumor immune response. Here, we investigate immunologic effects of metformin on natural killer (NK) and natural killer T cells, including results from two phase I open-label studies in patients with HNSCC treated with metformin (NCT02325401, NCT02083692). Peripheral blood was collected before and after metformin treatment or from newly diagnosed patients with HNSCC. Peripheral immune cell phenotypes were evaluated using flow cytometry, cytokine expression by ELISA and/or IsoLight, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was determined with a flow-based NK cell cytotoxicity assay (NKCA). Patient tumor immune infiltration before and after metformin treatment was analyzed with immunofluorescence. NK cells were treated with either vehicle or metformin and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NK cells were then treated with inhibitors of significant pathways determined by RNA-seq and analyzed by NKCA, ELISA, and western blot analyses. Increased peripheral NK cell activated populations were observed in patients treated with metformin. NK cell tumor infiltration was enhanced in patients with HNSCC treated with metformin preoperatively. Metformin increased antitumorigenic cytokines ex vivo, including significant increases in perforin. Metformin increased HNSCC NK cell cytotoxicity and inhibited the CXCL1 pathway while stimulating the STAT1 pathway within HNSCC NK cells. Exogenous CXCL1 prevented metformin-enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Metformin-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity was found to be AMP-activated protein kinase independent, but dependent on both mechanistic target of rapamycin and pSTAT1. Our data identifies a new role for metformin-mediated immune antitumorigenic function through NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and downregulation of CXCL1 in HNSCC. These findings will inform future immunomodulating therapies in HNSCC.",

Patients with pathologically confirmed advanced-stage ovarian cancer undergoing primary debulking or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery were eligible to participate. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy with metformin 850 mg orally twice per day or placebo, followed by maintenance therapy (metformin or placebo) for two years from the date of randomization. 108 evaluable patients were enrolled; 54 were randomly assigned to metformin, and 54 to placebo. Sixty-six percent (n = 71) received neoadjuvant therapy, 31 % (n = 33) primary debulking surgery, and 88 % (n = 93) had tumors of high-grade serous histology. The primary endpoint, PFS, was not significantly different between the treatment groups (1-sided p-value = 0.31; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-1.36). Median PFS was 15.4 months (95 % CI: 11.2-23,5) for metformin and 14.3 months (95 % CI: 11.6-18.0) for placebo. Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different (2-sided p-value = 0.21; adjusted HR = 1.49, 95 % CI: 0.86-2.59), with a median of 40.7 months (95 % CI: 28.0-48.2) for metformin versus 43.8 months (95 % CI: 35.3-57.2) for placebo. The addition of metformin was well tolerated, and there were no differences in toxicity between the two groups. Although it was well-tolerated, adding metformin to first-line platinum/taxane-based therapy does not improve PFS or OS for patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "Metformin, a well-known antidiabetic drug, has been repurposed for cancer treatment; however, recently observed drug resistance and tumor metastasis have questioned its further application. Here, we found that long-term metformin exposure led to metabolic adaptation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was characterized by an obvious epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). TOMM34, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated to promote tumor metastasis in response to metformin-induced metabolic stress. Mechanistically, TOMM34 interacted with ATP5B to preserve F<sub>1</sub> F<sub>O</sub> -ATPase activity, which conferred mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production. This metabolic preference for OXPHOS suggested a large requirement of energy supply by cancer cells to survive and spread in response to therapeutic stress. Notably, disturbing the interaction between TOMM34 and ATP5B using Gboxin, a specific OXPHOS inhibitor, increased sensitivity to metformin and suppressed tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study demonstrates a molecular link of the TOMM34/ATP5B-ATP synthesis axis during metformin adaptation and provides promising therapeutic targets for metformin sensitization in cancer treatment.",

We constructed a propensity score-matched retrospective cohort of 84,434 veterans newly prescribed metformin or a sulfonylurea as monotherapy. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to assess the association between metformin use compared to sulfonylurea use and incidence cancer risk for 10 solid tumors. We adjusted for clinical covariates including hemoglobin A1C, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, and body mass index. Incidence cancers were defined by ICD-9-CM codes. Among 42,217 new metformin users and 42,217 matched-new sulfonylurea users, we identified 2,575 incidence cancers. Metformin was inversely associated with liver cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.44, 95% CI 0.31, 0.64) compared to sulfonylurea. We found no association between metformin use and risk of incidence bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, prostate, or renal cancer when compared to sulfonylurea use. In this large cohort study that accounted for time-related biases, we observed no association between the use of metformin and most cancers; however, we found a strong inverse association between metformin and liver cancer. Randomized trials of metformin for prevention of liver cancer would be useful to verify these observations.",

Therefore, we conducted a phase Ib study using combination therapy with nivolumab and metformin in patients with refractory/recurrent solid tumors. This study consisted of two parts: 1, evaluating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics in solid tumors, and 2, principally investigating the safety at the recommended dose limited to thoracic and pancreatic cancers. Metformin and nivolumab were administered orally at doses of 750-2,250 mg/day and biweekly at a fixed intravenous dose of 3 mg/kg, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity was evaluated within the first 4 weeks. Both metformin and nivolumab were continued until disease progression or discontinued because of toxicity. In total, 17 and 24 patients were enrolled in parts 1 and 2, respectively. One patient experienced increased pancreatic enzyme levels (grade 4) and lactic acidosis (grade 3). No Grade 5 adverse events were observed. MTD was not reached up to 2,250 mg/day of metformin, 2,250 mg/day was selected for part 2. An objective response was observed in 4 of 41 patients. One-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 9.8% and 56.8%, respectively. Two patients remained alive without disease progression for more than three years. Nivolumab and metformin combination therapy was well-tolerated and showed preliminary signals of efficacy in a subset of patients.

GBMs high ability to infiltrate healthy brain tissues makes it difficult to remove surgically and account for its fatal outcomes. To improve the chances of survival, it is critical to screen for GBM-targeted anticancer agents with anti-invasive and antimigratory potential. Metformin, a commonly used drug for the treatment of diabetes, has recently emerged as a promising anticancer molecule. This prompted us, to investigate the anticancer potential of metformin against GBMs, specifically its effects on cell motility and invasion. The results show a significant decrease in the survival of SF268 cancer cells in response to treatment with metformin. Furthermore, metformin's efficiency in inhibiting 2D cell motility and cell invasion in addition to increasing cellular adhesion was also demonstrated in SF268 and U87 cells. Finally, AKT inactivation by downregulation of the phosphorylation level upon metformin treatment was also evidenced. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the anti-invasive antimetastatic potential of metformin as well as its underlying mechanism of action.",

Combination therapy with metformin and thiazolidinedione derivatives is frequently used, but its synergistic effects have not been thoroughly evaluated. This study aims to compare the therapeutic efficacy of low-dose spironolactone (LDS) at 0.25 mg/kg for 28 days, metformin at 500 mg/kg for 28 days, and a combination of LDS and metformin, against a letrozole (1 mg/kg/day) and 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)-induced PCOS rat model. The study involved five groups of laboratory animals: Group I (Healthy control), Group IIa (Disease control), Group IIb (Metformin), Group IIc (LDS), and Group IId (Metformin + LDS). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated based on phenotypic, hormonal, and genotypic determinants. Letrozole successfully induced PCOS in the animals, evidenced by elevated levels of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and progesterone, as well as the presence of multiple ovarian cysts. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis indicated that LDS was superior to metformin and the combination therapy in ameliorating PCOS symptoms. The findings suggest that there is little to no benefit in adding metformin to LDS for the clinical management of PCOS. Although these results are from preclinical studies, further case-controlled, randomized placebo studies on a larger patient sample are necessary to confirm these findings in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease associated with infertility and metabolic disorders in reproductive-aged women. In this study, we evaluated the expression of eight genes related to endometrial function and their DNA methylation levels in the endometrium of PCOS patients and women without the disease (control group). In addition, eight of the PCOS patients underwent intervention with metformin (1500 mg/day) and a carbohydrate-controlled diet (type and quantity) for three months. Clinical and metabolic parameters were determined, and RT-qPCR and MeDIP-qPCR were used to evaluate gene expression and DNA methylation levels, respectively. Decreased expression levels of <i>HOXA10</i>, <i>GAB1</i>, and <i>SLC2A4</i> genes and increased DNA methylation levels of the <i>HOXA10</i> promoter were found in the endometrium of PCOS patients compared to controls. After metformin and nutritional intervention, some metabolic and clinical variables improved in PCOS patients. This intervention was associated with increased expression of <i>HOXA10</i>, <i>ESR1, GAB1</i>, and <i>SLC2A4</i> genes and reduced DNA methylation levels of the <i>HOXA10</i> promoter in the endometrium of PCOS women. Our preliminary findings suggest that metformin and a carbohydrate-controlled diet improve endometrial function in PCOS patients, partly by modulating DNA methylation of the <i>HOXA10</i> gene promoter and the expression of genes implicated in endometrial receptivity and insulin signaling.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a commonly used drug for the treatment of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that it exerts anti-cancer effects in many cancers, including colorectal cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer metastasis remain unclear. Colorectal cancer cell lines were treated with metformin, and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were analyzed in vitro. The relationship between metformin and the AMPK-mTOR axis was assessed by Western blot analysis and transfection with small interfering RNA. A colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model was used to observe the effects of metformin on liver metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on liver metastatic tumors. In in vitro experiments, metformin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion only in HCT116 and SW837 cells, but not in HCT8 and Lovo cells. Only in HCT116 and SW837, a change in AMPK-mTOR expression was observed in a dose-dependent manner. In colorectal cancer xenograft mice, the liver metastatic rate (10% vs. 50%, p = 0.05) and the number of liver metastatic nodules (0.1/body vs. 1.2/body, p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the metformin group. Tumor proliferation and EMT were decreased and apoptosis was promoted only in metastatic liver tumors of mice treated with metformin. The molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer effects of metformin involves repression of mTOR pathways via AMPK activation. Moreover, the differences in metformin sensitivity depend on the response of the AMPK-mTOR pathway to metformin. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the anti-metastatic treatment of colorectal cancer using metformin.",

Drug repurposing is one attractive approach for cancer therapy. Disulfiram (DSF), used to treat alcoholism, inhibits cancer growth and we previously found that DSF perturbs protein degradation/turnover pathways in vitro. This was enhanced by combining DSF with the anti-diabetic drug metformin (Met). Here, we investigated DSF with/without Met, against OSCC in vivo. Nude mice injected subcutaneously with the human OSCC cell line WHCO1, were treated with 30 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg DSF three times per week and with/without Met, for 21 days. DSF and DSF/Met-treated animals had significantly smaller tumours compared to untreated, vehicle and positive control cisplatin-treated groups. This effect for DSF was independent of copper, with no significant accumulation of copper in tumours, together with maintained proteasome activity. However, increases in total ubiquitinated proteins, LC3B-II, LAMP1 and p62 in DSF and DSF/Met groups, indicate that autophagy is inhibited. These findings show that DSF and DSF/Met significantly impede OSCC tumour growth in vivo and offer prospective alternative chemotherapy approaches for OSCC.",

This study investigates the potential of metformin to enhance radiosensitivity in hypoxic cancer cells. Preliminary experiments were conducted to validate the impact of hypoxia on radiation response. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cell migration, and cell death were assessed in hypoxic, radiated cells treated with metformin. Proteomic and ontological analyses were employed to identify molecular targets associated with the radiosensitizing effect of metformin. Proteomic and ontological findings were validated through patient samples and in vitro studies. Metformin amplified cell death, induced DNA fragmentation, decreased cell migration, and elevated ROS levels in hypoxic, radiated cells. Proteomic analyses revealed that GAPDH and TAGLN2 were identified as pivotal targets linked to the radiosensitizing effect of metformin. Oral cancer patients exhibited elevated levels of TAGLN2 and reduced levels of GAPDH. Metformin downregulated TAGLN2 and upregulated GAPDH in hypoxic, radiated cells. Additionally, metformin reduced levels of mutated p53. This study suggests that metformin can enhance radiosensitivity in hypoxic cells, operating through modulation of GAPDH and TAGLN2. Furthermore, metformin effectively reduces mutated p53 levels in radiated cells under hypoxic conditions.",

Metformin inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, altering metabolism. Though the mechanism is unclear, epidemiologic studies show an association between metformin use and improved outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We sought to determine if metformin alters metabolism and apoptosis in HNSCC tumors. Window of opportunity trial of metformin between diagnostic biopsy and resection. Participants were patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC. Fifty patients were enrolled, and 39 completed a full-treatment course. Metformin was titrated to standard diabetic dose (2,000 mg/day) for a course of 9 or more days prior to surgery. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the metabolic markers caveolin-1 (CAV1), B-galactosidase (GALB), and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), as well as the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay and Ki-67 IHC, were performed in pre- and postmetformin specimens. Exploratory mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) to assess lactate levels also was performed in three subjects. Metformin was well tolerated. The average treatment course was 13.6 days. Posttreatment specimens showed a significant increase in stromal CAV1 (P < 0.001) and GALB (P < 0.005), as well as tumor cell apoptosis by TUNEL assay (P < 0.001). There was no significant change in stromal MCT4 expression or proliferation measured by Ki67. Lactate levels in carcinoma cells were increased 2.4-fold postmetformin (P < 0.05), as measured by MSI. Metformin increases markers of reduced catabolism and increases senescence in stromal cells as well as carcinoma cell apoptosis. This study demonstrates that metformin modulates metabolism in the HNSCC microenvironment. 4. Laryngoscope, 127:1808-1815, 2017.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that metformin may reduce breast cancer incidence, but reports are mixed and few provide information on tumor characteristics. Therefore, we assessed associations among diabetes, metformin use, and breast cancer in postmenopausal women participating in Women's Health Initiative clinical trials. In all, 68,019 postmenopausal women, including 3,401 with diabetes at study entry, were observed over a mean of 11.8 years with 3,273 invasive breast cancers diagnosed. Diabetes incidence status was collected throughout follow-up, with medication information collected at baseline and years 1, 3, 6, and 9. Breast cancers were confirmed by review of central medical records and pathology reports. Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for breast cancer risk factors, compared breast cancer incidence in women with diabetes who were metformin users or nonusers with breast cancer incidence in women without diabetes. Compared with that in women without diabetes, breast cancer incidence in women with diabetes differed by diabetes medication type (P = .04). Women with diabetes receiving medications other than metformin had a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.45), and women with diabetes who were given metformin had lower breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99). The association was observed for cancers positive for both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and those that were negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Metformin use in postmenopausal women with diabetes was associated with lower incidence of invasive breast cancer. These results can inform future studies evaluating metformin use in breast cancer management and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Metformin administration has recently emerged as a candidate strategy for the prevention of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the intricate relationship between genetic alterations in HNSCC and metformin sensitivity is still poorly understood, which prevents the stratification of patients, harboring oral premalignant lesions that may benefit from the chemopreventive activity of metformin. In this study, we investigate the impact of prevalent mutations in HNSCC on response to metformin. Notably, we found that the expression of oncogenic HRAS mutants confers resistance to metformin in isogenic HNSCC cell systems, and that HNSCC cells harboring endogenous HRAS mutations display limited sensitivity to metformin. Remarkably, we found that metformin fails to reduce activation of the mTOR pathway in HRAS oncogene-expressing HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo, correlating with reduced tumor suppressive activity. Mechanistically, we found that this process depends on the ability of HRAS to enhance glycolytic metabolism, thereby suppressing the requirement for oxidative phosphorylation to maintain the cellular energetic balance. Overall, our study revealed that HNSCC cells with oncogenic HRAS mutations exhibit diminished metformin sensitivity, thus shedding light on a potential mechanism of treatment resistance. This finding may also help explain the limited clinical responses to metformin in cancers with RAS mutations. Ultimately, our study underscores the importance of understanding the impact of the genetic landscape in tailoring precision cancer-preventive approaches in the context of HNSCC and other cancers that are characterized by the presence of a defined premalignant state, and therefore, are amenable to cancer interception strategies. Prevention Relevance: Our findings highlight the challenges of using metformin for cancer prevention in RAS-mutant cancers, where elevated glycolysis may reduce drug efficacy. This underscores the need to explore metformin's potential in early, premalignant stages, before metabolic shifts render it less effective.",

Interest in repurposing metformin to treat cancer has not been translated into encouraging clinical benefit. In animal models, metformin activated cytotoxic T cells and exerted an immune-mediated anticancer effect. The current research was conducted to investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of metformin in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide in an experimental cancer model. Ehrlich ascites carcinoma was injected into the subcutaneous tissue to induce solid tumors in syngeneic mice. Exponential solid tumor growth ensued and was effectively arrested with the administration of a cytotoxic dose of parenteral cyclophosphamide. Alternatively, oral metformin and continuous, low-dose cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited tumor growth relative to untreated mice. The drug combination was well tolerated. Histopathological examination of the tumor showed an increased number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and enhanced expression of granzyme B by this drug combination. The current data suggests a potential role of metformin and metronomic chemotherapy that warrants further investigation.",

This cohort study included 87,600 patients with type 2 diabetes in The Health Improvement Network database. Use of metformin or an SU was treated as a time-dependent variable. Cox regression-generated hazard ratios (HRs) compared metformin use with SU use, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, obesity, and HbA1c level. We identified 196 incident bladder cancers in the metformin cohort and 66 cancers in the SU cohort. Use of metformin was not associated with decreased bladder cancer risk (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.60-1.09]). This association did not differ by sex (P for interaction = 0.20). We observed no association with duration of metformin relative to SU use (3 to <4 years of use: 0.57 [0.25-1.34]; 4 to <5 years of use: 0.93 [0.30-2.85; ≥5 years of use: 1.18 [0.44-3.19]; P for trend = 0.26). Use of metformin is not associated with a decreased incidence of bladder cancer. Similar methods should be used to study other cancers that have previously been identified as potentially preventable with metformin.",

As the premetastatic niche acts as a prerequisite for tumor metastasis, it serves as an effective target for metastasis suppression. This study tests the feasibility of inhalable porous microspheres loaded with two premetastatic niche modulation agents, metformin and docosahexaenoic acid, as orthotopic delivery carriers for the reversion of lung premetastatic microenvironments and targeted suppression of tumor lung metastasis. The microspheres were prepared <i>via</i> an improved emulsion-solvent evaporation method and exhibit an excellent lung deposition, leading to significant inhibition of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-endothelial cells adhesion, reduction of vascular permeability, and suppression of adhesion protein expression in lung premetastatic microenvironments. As a result, inhalable microspheres can prevent tumor lung metastasis formation excellently <i>in vivo</i>. Overall, this study proved that the encapsulation of metformin and docosahexaenoic acid in inhalable microspheres could be a promising strategy for tumor lung metastasis inhibition <i>via</i> orthotopically modulating premetastatic niche in the lungs.",

The inverse variance weighted(IVW) was used as the primary method for MR analysis. In addition, MR-Egger, weighted median, heterogeneity tests, and sensitivity analyses were performed. The initial and validation MR analyses indicated that genetically predicted metformin treatment had no effects on PCOS.

      "abstract": "Metformin (Met), a widely used type II diabetes medication, has shown anti-cancer properties in various cancers. RBMS3 is a tumor suppressor implicated in several cancers, including ovarian cancer. Ferroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, is gaining attention in cancer research. This study explores whether metformin induces ferroptosis and inhibits ovarian cancer progression through the RBMS3 pathway. We used a CCK-8 assay to determine the optimal metformin concentration for ovarian cancer cells. Metformin's effects were further evaluated using EdU assay and flow cytometry. To clarify its mechanism, we employed programmed cell death inhibitors and measured levels of MDA (Malondialdehyde), GSH (Glutathione), and Fe²⁺. Ferroptosis-related proteins and RBMS3 expression in ovarian cancer tissues and cells were assessed via RT-qPCR and Western blotting. A xenograft mouse model was used to observe metformin's effects on tumor growth. Metformin inhibited the viability of ovarian cancer A2780 cells, promoted ferroptosis, increased MDA and Fe²⁺ levels, and reduced GSH. It upregulated ferroptosis-related genes while downregulating GPX4 and SLC7A11. Although RBMS3 was reduced in cancer cells, metformin increased its expression, and silencing RBMS3 reversed metformin's effects. In vivo, metformin inhibited tumor growth, which was negated by RBMS3 silencing. Our findings suggest that metformin promotes ferroptosis and inhibits ovarian cancer progression by upregulating RBMS3, offering a promising direction for clinical application in ovarian cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Changing the vision, understanding, interpretation and analysis of certain data or scientific dilemmas is what is able to change the status quo and revitalize a mission, an impulse or important thoughts, thus creating the conditions for it to increase immensely the chances of bringing it to success. Or, following Albert Einstein's postulate: ˝We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them˝, we should think: ˝Where does the road to success start? How do we solve or neutralize a problem? ˝ And the answer is: ˝ By taking a consistent and systematic approach, analyzing each component! And we eliminate every possibility of negative influence.˝ These thoughts apply with full force to cancer rates in general, but also to melanoma rates in particular: the murderous tempo of globalization and modernization in medicine has not yet led to the desired decrease in these rates; on the contrary, they are rising headlong and remain largely unpredictable and difficult to regulate. The conclusion is that a solution should be sought by refracting light through another prism: that of Nitrosogenesis and Pharmaco-Oncogenesis. A step-by-step and systematic approach to solving a problem requires patience, determination, and perseverance. As this perseverance is needed mainly to overcome the general ignorance, neglect, disinterest, uneducation and uncertainty of others, rather than doubt in one's own thesis, analysis, and the need for an active approach. Careful analysis of concepts such as ˝Drug Mediated Nitrosogenesis˝ and ˝Onco-pharmacogenesis/Pharmaco-oncogenesis˝ of skin cancer would certainly contribute to the elucidation of skin carcinogenesis in the context of polymedication of the contamination and polymorbidity worldwide. The FDA has already in 2019 taken this much needed first step of universal awareness and its ˝arm˝ has been taken seriously and responsibly solely by dermatologists and dermatosurgeons. It was this guild and only this guild that launched its independent, never-ending observations, logically grounded (hypo)theses, remaining to date confirmatory, unshakable, and enigmatic regarding the unit: intake of potentially contaminated medication and subsequent development of melanomas. It is this and only this branch of the medical guild that has also become the guarantor of safety and objectivity in science, and thus of safety in the fight for survival of a huge number of skin cancer patients. Contaminated oral antidiabetic drugs in the face of Metformin and Sitagliptin do not make an exception in this respect. Similarly to cutaneous melanomas occurring (and published in the scientific literature) after combined intake (or monomedication) of/ between ranitidine, valsartan, olmesartan, candesartan, telmisartan, irbesartan, losartan, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, amlodipine, propafenone, bisoprolol, nebivolol, melitracen and a number of others, we inform about another rare but not unexpected clinical observation: occurrence of cutaneous melanomas after taking another class of drugs- oral antidiabetic ones. Or after the intake of nitrosamine-contaminated antidiabetic drugs. And whether this contamination is \"real or potential\" is left to regulators and manufacturers to decide. We accept it as `real-potential' or `potentially-real' because of the fact that neither the regulators nor the manufacturers know what it is or whether it is there or how it arose. The data shared in patients one and two in the presented scientific work are confirmatory in relation to the potential pathogenetic action of nitrosamine contaminated drugs such as 1) bisoprolol/ nebivolol/ candesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, as well as 2) furosemide in the direction of cutaneous melanoma. Patient 3 in fact also represents the first formally described patient with subsequent melanoma development worldwide, having developed it following intake of potentially/actually nitrosamine-contaminated metformin and metformin/sitagliptin (both drugs are themed in the FDA's Potentially Contaminated Drug Bulletin: 1) metformin, multiple times between 2020-21, due to its contamination with NDMA and 2) sitagliptin, as of September 2022, due to its contamination with NTTP). It should not be seen as surprising to anyone that the intake of relatively similar carcinogens/nitrosamines or NDSRIs, but as an unofficial component of heterogeneous drugs, produces a relatively monomorphic clinical picture- that of cutaneous melanoma. Or to put it metaphorically: ˝The wolf changes its hair, but not its mood˝. A carcinogen remains a carcinogen, regardless of whether it is ingested in a lemonade, a tablet, a sandwich, or a bonbon. Similarly to the intake of nitrosamines in food. Future studies should address the important tasks/dilemmas to elucidate 1) the phototoxic/photocarcinogenic effect of unmetabolized nitrosamines identified in drug formulations; 2) the phototoxic/photocarcinogenic effect of DNA adducts generated after their metabolization, and 3) the availability of specific DNA adducts in lesional/tumor tissue and blood of patients after ingestion of nitroso-containing drug formulations. This level of evidence is likely to lead to a reconsideration of the arguments for the introduction of permanent elimination regimes for nitrosamines in medicines. Metabolic reprogramming (and its relationship to UVB radiation) due to the availability of nitrosamines in cigarette smoke is also currently a proven reality. Based on the available clinicopathological correlations, we believe that nitrosamines in drugs have a similar effect and are part of the key pathway activating skin carcinogenesis under the influence of solar radiation. Intake of contaminated medication is associated with skin cancer generation and progression. It is up to regulators and manufacturers to justify the merits and benefits of the self-imposed presence of carcinogens in drugs or the benefits of such drugs. Apart from the \"cancer-generating benefit\", of course, which is already widely known. And let us not forget that: \"A lie stops being a lie and becomes a truth the moment it is officially refuted\".",

We evaluated outcomes in a cohort of 6225 women with T2DM with a new diagnosis of ovarian, breast or endometrial cancer from 2010 to 2019. We classified glycemic medications at time of first cancer diagnosis into 3 tiers in accordance with ADA guidelines. Approaches compared: (i) metformin (tier 1) vs. no glycemic medication, (ii) metformin vs tier 2 medications (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, SGLT2-inhibitors, DPP4-inhibitors, alpha glucosidase-inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists), (iii) metformin vs tier 3 medications (insulins, amylinomimetics), and (iv) tier 2 vs tier 3 medications. Analyses included Cox proportional-hazards models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and conditional logistic regression in a risk set-sampled nested case-control matched on T2DM duration- all modeling survival. Models were adjusted for demographics, cancer type, A1C, T2DM duration, and number of office visits and hospitalizations. Metformin was the most used medication (n = 3232) and consistently demonstrated survival benefit compared with tier 2 and 3 medications, across all methods. Tier 3-users demonstrated highest risk of death when compared to metformin rather than tier 2 [adjHR = 1.83 (95% CI: 1.58, 2.13) vs. adjHR = 1.32 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.57)], despite similar baseline profiles between tier 1 and 2 users. Metformin users experienced increased survival even after accounting for surrogates of diabetes progression. Benefit extended beyond that seen in tier 2-users. Our findings, consistent with prior studies, indicate metformin use improves survival in women with T2DM and hormonally mediated women's cancers.",

Examining metabolic pathways affected by biguanide treatments in cancer cells that are highly sensitive to biguanides, we found that biguanide treatment depletes cellular levels of both aspartate and NAD+. Experiments to replenish these metabolites or block steps of the aspartate-malate shuttle suggest that depletion of both metabolites, rather than either aspartate of NAD+ individually, is critical for growth-inhibitory effects of biguanide exposure. Even in sensitive cancer cells, though, biguanide treatment alone over a broad range of doses only inhibits cell replication without significantly affecting cell viability. Noting that clinical observations of biguanide efficacy have used combinations of agents that typically include cisplatin, we found that biguanide treatment at a cytostatic level substantially decreases survival of lung cancer and breast cancer cells when co-treated with cisplatin at doses that alone are also non-cytotoxic. This striking enhancement of cisplatin toxicity by biguanides depends on reductions of levels of NAD+ and aspartate, since addition of either of these metabolites prevented this potentiation of cisplatin cytotoxicity. Thus, biguanide drugs can have cytotoxic effects when used in combination with other cancer drugs, such as cisplatin, and depleting cellular levels of NAD+ and aspartate is critical for enhancing the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by biguanide drugs in sensitive cancer cells.",

It is thought that the suppression of mTOR signaling is involved in metformin's anti-cancer action. Although liver cancer is one of the most responsive types of cancer for reduction of incidence by metformin, the molecular mechanism of the suppression of mTOR in liver remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation using human liver cancer cells. Metformin suppressed phosphorylation of p70-S6 kinase, and ribosome protein S6, downstream targets of mTOR, and suppressed cell proliferation. We found that DEPTOR, an endogenous substrate of mTOR suppression, is involved in the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in human liver cancer cells. Metformin increases the protein levels of DEPTOR, intensifies binding to mTOR, and exerts a suppressing effect on mTOR signaling. This increasing effect of DEPTOR by metformin is regulated by the proteasome degradation system; the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation is in a DEPTOR-dependent manner. Furthermore, metformin exerts a suppressing effect on proteasome activity, DEPTOR-related mTOR signaling, and cell proliferation in an AMPK-dependent manner. We conclude that DEPTOR-related mTOR suppression is involved in metformin's anti-cancer action in liver, and could be a novel target for anti-cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Findings from studies of metformin use with risk of cancer incidence and outcome provide mixed results; with few studies examined associations by recency of diabetes diagnosis or duration of medication use. Thus, in the Women's Health Initiative, we examined these associations and further explored whether associations differ by recency of diabetes and duration of metformin use. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals. Diabetes was associated with higher risk of total invasive cancer (HR, 1.13; p < 0.001) and of several site-specific cancers (HR, 1.2-1.4, and up to over twofold). Diabetes was also associated with higher risk of death from cancer (HR, 1.46; p < 0.001). There was no overall difference in cancer incidence by diabetes therapy (p = 0.66). However, there was a lower risk of death from cancer for metformin users, compared to users of other medications, relative to women without diabetes, overall (HRs, 1.08 vs. 1.45; p = 0.007) and for breast cancer (HRs, 0.50 vs. 1.29; p = 0.05). Results also suggested that lower cancer risk associated with metformin may be evident only for a longer duration of use in certain cancer sites or subgroup populations. We provide further evidence that postmenopausal women with diabetes are at higher risk of invasive cancer and cancer death. Metformin users, particularly long-term users, may be at lower risk of developing certain cancers and dying from cancer, compared to users of other anti-diabetes medications. Future studies are needed to determine the long-term effect of metformin in cancer risk and survival from cancer.",

      "abstract": "The biological influence of antidiabetic drugs on cancer cells and diabetic cancer patients has not yet been completely elucidated. We reported that a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor accelerates mammary cancer metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the CXCL12/CXCR4/mTOR axis. Metformin has been shown to inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated whether metformin mitigates breast cancer metastasis induced by a DPP-4 inhibitor via suppression of mTOR signaling. In cultured mouse mammary and human breast cancer cells, metformin suppressed DPP-4 inhibitor KR62436 (KR)-induced EMT and cell migration via suppression of the mTOR pathway associated with AMPK activation. For the <i>in vivo</i> study, metformin intervention was performed in an allograft 4T1 breast cancer model mouse with or without KR. We also analyzed mice transplanted with shRNA-mediated DPP-4 knockdown 4T1 cells. Treatment with metformin inhibited the lung metastasis of DPP-4-deficient 4T1 mammary tumor cells generated by either KR administration or DPP-4 knockdown. Immunostaining of primary tumors indicated that DPP-4 suppression promoted the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factor Snail through activation of the CXCR4-mediated mTOR/p70S6K pathway in an allograft breast cancer model; metformin abolished this alteration. Metformin treatment did not alter DPP-4-deficiency-induced expression of CXCL12 in either plasma or primary tumors. Our findings suggest that metformin may serve as an antimetastatic agent by mitigating the undesirable effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with certain cancers. IMPLICATIONS: Metformin could combat the detrimental effects of DPP-4 inhibitor on breast cancer metastasis via mTOR suppression, suggesting the potential clinical relevance.

Its antiandrogenic properties further serve as an add-on to the conventional management of hirsutism associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Very recently, systemic usage of metformin for psoriasis and cutaneous malignancies has shown promising results. Interestingly, metformin has also been topically used in hyperpigmentary disorders with pertinent levels of improvement and happens to be the most recent addition to the list of dermatologic indications.

      "abstract": "Observational clinical studies of metformin for prevention and treatment of several cancer types have reported mixed findings. Although preclinical studies have suggested metformin may reduce head and neck cancer (HNC) proliferation, clinical evidence is limited. The objective of this large population-based study was to evaluate the relationship between metformin exposure following HNC diagnosis and all-cause mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Italian Emilia-Romagna Regional administrative healthcare database, which includes demographic, hospital and outpatient prescription information for ~4.5 million residents. Included patients were followed from the first hospital discharge (index) during the study period (01/2003-12/2012) with a diagnosis of HNC. Metformin exposure and select covariates were operationalized in a time-dependent manner during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the covariate-adjusted time-dependent association between metformin exposure and all-cause mortality. Among 7872 patients diagnosed with HNC, 708 (9.0%) were exposed to metformin after HNC diagnosis, and 3626 (46.1%) died during follow-up (median follow-up: 35.2 months). In the covariate-adjusted model, the all-cause mortality rate appeared lower (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.61-1.09) among metformin exposed patients during the 2 years post-diagnosis, while the all-cause mortality rate appeared higher (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.94-1.53) among exposed patients after 2 years post-diagnosis. Metformin was protective among patients ≤60 years of age (HR for the period of 0-2 years post-diagnosis: 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.56; HR for the period ≥2 years post-diagnosis: 0.56, 95% CI 0.26-1.22) but not in those >60 years. In this population-based study of metformin in HNC, we found a modest protective association between metformin exposure and all-cause mortality in the 2-year post-diagnosis period. Age appeared to modify the association between metformin and HNC survival.",

This study assessed whether metformin use after non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis is associated with overall survival among type II diabetic patients with NSCLC in the U.S. military health system (MHS). The study included 636 diabetic patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC diagnosed between 2002 and 2007, identified from the linked database from the Department of Defense's Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). Time-dependent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between metformin use and overall survival during follow-up. Among the 636 patients, 411 died during the follow-up. The median follow-up time was 14.6 months. Increased post-diagnosis cumulative use (per 1 year of use) conferred a significant reduction in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.65-0.88). Further analysis by duration of use revealed that compared to non-users, the lowest risk reduction occurred among patients with the longest duration of use (i.e. use for more than 2 years) (HR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.09-0.40). Finally, the reduced mortality was particularly observed only among patients who also used metformin before lung cancer diagnosis and among patients at early stage of diagnosis. Prolonged duration of metformin use in the study population was associated with improved survival, especially among early stage patients. Future research with a larger number of patients is warranted.",

Metformin increased cellular FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a, AMPK, p-AMPK, and MnSOD levels in HDFs but not in HCT116 cells. Cellular ATP level was decreased only in HDFs by metformin. Metformin increased ROS level only in HCT116 cells. Transfection of si-FOXO3a into HCT116 reversed the metformin-induced cellular ROS induction, indicating that FOXO3a/MnSOD is the key regulator for cellular ROS level. Viability readout with M, E, and F alone decreased slightly, but the combination of three drugs dramatically decreased cell survival in HCT116, A549, and SK-Hep-1 cancer cells but not in HDF cells. ROS levels in HCT116 cells were massively increased by M + E + F combination, but not in HDF cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that of M + E + F combination caused cell death only in HCT116 cells. The combination of M + E + F reduced synergistically mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I and III activities in HCT116 cells when compared with individual treatments. Western blot analysis indicated that DNA damage, apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis-realated factors increased in M + E + F-treated HCT116 cells. Oral administration with M + E + F combination for 3 weeks caused dramatic reductions in tumor volume and weight in HCT116 xenograft model of nude mice when compared with untreated ones. Our results suggest that M + E + F have profound anticancer activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> via a cancer cell-specific ROS amplification (CASRA) through ROS-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Conventional cancer treatments face significant limitations, prompting the exploration of immune combination therapies targeting immune checkpoints as a means to overcome these challenges. The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation and immune evasion. TPP1, a peptide inhibitor targeting PD-L1, effectively blocks this pathway and suppresses tumor growth. Metformin has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of PD-L1. To leverage the synergistic therapeutic effects of TPP-1 and metformin, we designed and constructed a peptide-small molecule drug delivery system using tumor cell membranes. First, nanoscale tumor cell membrane vesicles were prepared via hypotonic ultrafiltration and coupled with the TPP1 peptide through co-incubation to form TPP1-cell membrane complexes. Simultaneously, mesoporous silica nanomaterials were synthesized and loaded with metformin by using the sol-gel method. Finally, the two components were mixed and sonicated to create the final drug delivery system. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results demonstrated that this tumor cell membrane-based drug delivery system significantly prolonged the half-life of TPP1, maintained its ability to activate T cells and promote IFN-γ secretion, and effectively inhibited tumor growth. Our constructed nanodelivery system could provide a promising therapeutic platform for co-delivery of peptides and small-molecule inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is associated with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. Recent studies showed that the antidiabetic agent metformin decreases proliferation of cancer cells through 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent inhibition of mTOR. In the current study, we assessed the effect of metformin on MTC cells. For this purpose, we determined growth, viability, migration, and resistance to anoikis assays using two MTC-derived cell lines (TT and MZ-CRC-1). Expressions of molecular targets of metformin were examined in MTC cell lines and in 14 human MTC tissue samples. We found that metformin inhibited growth and decreased expression of cyclin D1 in MTC cells. Treatment with metformin was associated with inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K/pS6 signaling and downregulation of pERK in both TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells. Metformin had no significant effects on pAKT in the cell lines examined. Metformin-inducible AMPK activation was noted only in TT cells. Treatment with AMPK inhibitor (compound C) or AMPK silencing did not prevent growth inhibitory effects of metformin in TT cells. Metformin had no effect on MTC cell migration but reduced the ability of cells to form multicellular spheroids in nonadherent conditions. Immunostaining of human MTC showed over-expression of cyclin D1 in all tumors compared with corresponding normal tissue. Activation of mTOR/p70S6K was detected in 8/14 (57.1%) examined tumors. Together, these findings indicate that growth inhibitory effects in MTC cells are associated with downregulation of both mTOR/6SK and pERK signaling pathways. Expression of metformin's molecular targets in human MTC cells suggests its potential utility for the treatment of MTC in patients.",

However, its clinical impact remains unclear in lung cancer. Between 2017 and 2021, 466 patients received ICI monotherapy. Patients were categorized into concurrent (MET; metformin or combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitor) and without concomitant (NMET; nonmetformin/DPP4 inhibitors) administration of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors groups at least 8 weeks before and during ICI therapy. The primary objectives were the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The second objective was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Among 466 patients, 89 (19.0%) and 377 (81%) were categorized into the MET and NMET groups, respectively. MET group had a significantly higher ORR (MET group: 24.7% vs. NMET group: 14.8%, p = 0.025) and longer PFS than those in the NMET group (MET group 5.1 month vs. NMET group 2.8 months, p = 0.018). After patients were stratified based on the prior line of therapy and PD L1 expression status, the PFS of the second-line therapy and PD L1 ≥50 was significantly higher in the MET than in the NMET group. The proportion of patients experiencing all-grade irAEs was numerically higher in the MET group (19.1%) than in the NMET group (14.3%), without statistical significance (p = 0.382). Concurrent use of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors with ICIs significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the incidence of irAEs in NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "We conducted a preoperative window study of metformin in endometrial cancer (EC) patients and evaluated its antiproliferative, molecular and metabolic effects. Twenty obese women with endometrioid EC were treated with metformin (850 mg) daily for up to 4 weeks prior to surgical staging. Expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were measured by immunohistochemistry. Global, untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum pre- and postmetformin treatment, and matched tumor, was performed. Metformin reduced proliferation by 11.75% (P = 0.008) based on the comparison of pre- and posttreatment endometrial tumors. A total of 65% of patients responded to metformin as defined by a decrease in Ki-67 staining in their endometrial tumors post-treatment. Metformin decreased expression of phosphorylated (p)-AMPK (P = 0.00001), p-Akt (P = 0.0002), p-S6 (51.2%, P = 0.0002), p-4E-BP-1 (P = 0.001), and ER (P = 0.0002) but not PR expression. Metabolomic profiling of serum indicated that responders versus nonresponders to treatment were more sensitive to metformin's effects on induction of lipolysis, which correlated with increased fatty acid oxidation and glycogen metabolism in matched tumors. In conclusion, metformin reduced tumor proliferation in a pre-operative window study in obese EC patients, with dramatic effects on inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Metformin induced a shift in lipid and glycogen metabolism that was more pronounced in the serum and tumors of responders versus nonresponders to treatment.This study provides support for therapeutic clinical trials of metformin in obese patients with EC.",

We sought to determine whether metformin combined with chemoradiation would improve HNSCC patient survival compared to historical controls. We conducted a Phase I/II prospective, single arm clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC (NCT02949700). Patients received platinum-based chemoradiation in combination with orally dosed metformin at one of 2 doses- 850 mg BID or 1500 mg BID administered during radiation, with a 2-week lead-in phase. Toxicity, disease response and survival metrics were ascertained throughout the study period. A total of 25 patients were evaluable for toxicity and survival; 9 failed to reach the predetermined 70% compliance with the study drug. No dose limiting toxicities were identified in the Phase I component and there were no grade 4 adverse events likely related to metformin throughout the study. The primary outcome for the Phase II component was met with a response rate of 96%. Three-year overall survival was ∼70% in the per protocol p16 + cohort and 0% in the per protocol p16- cohort. Survival among participants with a ≥70% metformin compliance to <70% metformin compliance demonstrated a trend towards improvement in the ≥70% compliance cohort, though this did not reach significance. Metformin is well tolerated during concurrent chemoradiation for HNSCC. Its effectiveness as a chemo-radiosensitizer remains unclear and will require further study with randomized controlled clinical trials in this patient population.",

The purpose of this study is to validate the association of PCOS with PI3K/AKT pathway target genes, miRNA486-5p, and miRNA483-5p as well as to evaluate the outcome of metformin on the pathogenesis of PCOS.  METHODS: This case-controlled study included 3 subject groups: twenty healthy females (control group), twenty PCOS females before treatment, and twenty PCOS females treated with metformin at a dose (500 mg 3 times per day for 3 months). The following gene expressions were assessed by real-time PCR: PI3K, AKT, ERK, GLUT4, miRNA486-5p, and miRNA483-5p in the whole blood. There was a significant decrease in miRNA486-5p and miRNA483-5p in the PCOS group with a significant negative correlation between miRNA486-5p and PI3K and a significant negative correlation between miRNA483-5p and ERK. Metformin treatment resulted in significant elevation of the studied miRNA, significant downregulation of PI3K/AKT target genes, and significant amelioration of the gonadotrophic hormonal imbalance and insulin resistance markers: fasting blood glucose, HBA1C, fasting insulin, and GLUT4 gene expression. miRNA486 and miRNA483 downregulation may contribute to the etiology of PCOS, influence glucose metabolism, and result in IR in PCOS. Metformin's upregulation of those miRNAs affects glucose metabolism by controlling the expression of GLUT4, ameliorates PCOS-related insulin resistance, and improves PCOS-related hormonal imbalance by controlling the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

Patients were enrolled in 1 of 4 sequential cohorts (10 patients each) of sorafenib doses (800 mg, 600 mg. 400 mg, and 200 mg) with A and M. Progression from one level to the next was based on prespecified minimum disease stabilization (at least 4/10) and upper limits of specific grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). The study was able to progress through all 4 dosing levels of sorafenib by the accrual of 40 patients. Thirty-eight (95%) patients had either main portal vein thrombosis or/and extra-hepatic disease. The most common grade 3-5 TRAEs were hand-foot-syndrome (grade 2 and grade 3) in 3 (8%) and transaminitis in 2 (5%) patients, respectively. The plasma concentrations of sorafenib peaked at 600 mg dose, and the concentration threshold of 2400 ng/mL was associated with higher odds of achieving time to exposure (TTE) concentrations >75% centile (odds ratio [OR] = 10.0 [1.67-44.93]; P = .01). The median overall survival for patients without early hepatic decompensation (n = 31) was 8.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-14.5 months). The SAM combination in HCC patients with predominantly unfavorable baseline disease characteristics showed a marked reduction in sorafenib-related side effects. Studies using sorafenib 600 mg per day in this combination along with sorafenib drug level monitoring can be evaluated in further trials.(Trial ID: CTRI/2018/07/014865).",

The estrous cycle of 50 adult Wistar female rats was monitored through vaginal smears. Subsequently, the rats were randomly assigned into five groups of 10, including control (receiving 1ml of carboxymethyl cellulose for 49 days), induction (letrozole at 1mg/kg/d for 21 days), SAE, Met, and SAE/Met. SAE and Met were orally administered at doses of 400mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d on day 22 and continued for an additional 28 days. Vaginal smears were analyzed, and gene expression levels of GLUT4, SIRT1, TNF-α, and INSR were evaluated using RT-qPCR. Antioxidant parameters were assessed using detection kits. Treatment with SAE and Met restored a regular estrous cycle pattern in PCOS rats. Furthermore, SAE and Met treatment improved hormonal balance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia in the rats. Administration of SAE and Met significantly elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPx in ovarian tissue (P<0.001). Additionally, mRNA levels of GLUT4, SIRT1, and INSR were significantly increased in ovarian tissue following SAE and Met treatment, while TNF-α gene expression decreased significantly (P<0.0001). The findings suggest that SAE and Met aqueous extract exert protective effects on letrozole-induced PCOS in rats by modulating gene expression associated with insulin signaling and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear chromatin protein overexpressed in various cancers and linked to tumor progression. Outside the cell, HMGB1 binds to receptors such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), promoting metastasis. Targeting this signaling pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive cancers. Metformin, a well-established antidiabetic drug, directly interacts with HMGB1, inhibiting its pro-inflammatory functions. This study investigates metformin's effects on the HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Using wound-healing and colony formation assays, we demonstrate that metformin reduces HMGB1-induced cell migration and proliferation. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses reveal that metformin decreases RAGE stabilization on the cell membrane, disrupts NF-κB signaling, and reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin, reducing vimentin, and stabilizing β-catenin at the cell membrane. Furthermore, metformin lowers HMGB1 and RAGE protein levels, disrupting the positive feedback loop that promotes cancer aggressiveness. These findings highlight metformin's potential as a therapeutic agent in TNBC by inhibiting HMGB1/RAGE-driven metastasis.",

      "abstract": "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as an energy sensor in eukaryotic cells and occupies a central role in linking metabolism and cancer development. However, the phosphorylation status of AMPK and its therapeutic value in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The phosphorylation status of AMPK (Thr172) was determined by immunoblotting and immunostaining in specimens from 273 patients with HCC (including 253 patients with hepatitis B virus -related HCC). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the correlation with prognosis. The effects of therapeutic metformin/AMPK activation were assessed in cultured human HCC cell lines and primary HCC cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors model in vivo. To define the mechanisms of anticancer effects of metformin, we examined its influence on AMPK activation and NF-κB pathway. AMPK is dysfunctional in patients with HCC, and low p-AMPK staining is correlated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and poor prognosis. Activation of AMPK by metformin not only inhibited HCC cells growth in vitro and in vivo, but also augmented cisplatin-induced growth inhibition in HCC cells. Knockdown of AMPKα expression can greatly decrease the inhibitory effect of metformin, indicating that AMPK activation is required for the anticancer action of metformin. Mechanistically, metformin/AMPK activation inhibited NF-κB signaling through upregulation of IκBα. Activation of NF-κB signaling by ectopic expression of P65 or overexpression of an undegradable mutant form of IκBα attenuated the anticancer effects of metformin. These results present novel insight into a critical role of AMPK in HCC progression. Anticancer effects of therapeutic metformin/AMPK activation unravel metformin's potential in treatment of HCC.",

Repurposing existing drugs as adjuvants accelerates the pace of cancer immune therapy research; however, many combinations exacerbate the immunogenic response elicited by ICIs and can lead to adverse immune-related events. Metformin, a widely used type 2 diabetes drug is an ideal candidate to repurpose as it has a good safety profile and studies suggest that metformin can modulate the tumour microenvironment, promoting a favourable environment for T cell activation but has no direct action on T cell activation on its own. In the current study we used PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-KCNA3P, a radiopharmaceutical specifically targeting K<sub>V</sub>1.3 the potassium channel over-expressed on active effector memory T-cells, to determine whether combining PD1 with metformin leads to an enhanced immunological memory response in a preclinical colorectal cancer model. Flow cytometry was used to assess which immune cell populations infiltrate the tumours in response to the treatment combination. Imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-KCNA3P demonstrated that adjuvant metformin significantly improved anti-PD1 efficacy and led to a robust anti-tumour immunological memory response in a syngeneic colon cancer model through changes in tumour infiltrating effector memory T-cells.",

Recent studies indicate that glucose deprivation can greatly enhance metformin-mediated inhibition of cell viability, but the molecular mechanism involved in this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we report that, under glucose deprivation, metformin inhibited expression of ΔNp63α, a p53 family member involved in cell adhesion pathways, resulting in disruption of cell matrix adhesion and subsequent apoptosis in human squamous carcinoma cells. We further show that metformin promoted ΔNp63α protein instability independent of AMP-activated protein kinase and that WWP1, an E3 ligase of ΔNp63α, was involved in metformin-mediated down-regulation of ΔNp63α levels. In addition, we demonstrate that a combination of metformin and the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose significantly inhibited ΔNp63α expression and also suppressed xenographic tumor growth <i>in vivo</i> In summary, this study reveals a new mechanism for metformin-mediated anticancer activity and suggests a new strategy for treating human squamous cell carcinoma.",

This study aimed to observe and analyze whether metformin use is associated with better prognosis in pancreatic cancer. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In this retrospective cohort study, all baseline data were retrieved from The Chinese Medicine Information Retrieval System (https://dc.wzhospital.cn/vpn/index.html) of The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Survival data were collected by follow-up visits and medical records. Overall survival was the primary endpoint, while progression-free survival and disease-free survival were secondary endpoints. Progression or recurrence was assessed with radiologic images. <b>Results:</b> Seventy-six metformin users and 92 metformin nonusers diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2012 to 2020 in this hospital were enrolled. The adjusted hazard ratio for overall survival for metformin users was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.76), where median overall survival was 16.0 months for metformin users versus 11.5 months for metformin nonusers. The protective effect was also found by analyzing progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.86) and disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.68). In the subgroup analysis, metformin use had a statistically significant association with prolongation of survival in stage I to II pancreatic cancer patients (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.91), but not for advanced tumor stage (hazard ratio for IV stage = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.33-1.19), after adjustment for other risk factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> Metformin use is related to favorable survival outcomes of pancreatic cancer, especially in early tumor stage.",

One such medication is metformin, a drug commonly used to manage diabetes, which shows a favorable correlation between its use and lower cancer morbidity and death. Numerous investigations and clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the possible application of metformin as an anticancer medication in light of this conclusion. This study used 'pathway/gene-set analysis' Gene2drug, a resource for Gene Ontology (GO), and DepMap to determine whether metformin would be potentially advantageous for treating cancer. A total of 1826 tumor cell lines were analyzed using the Drug Sensitivity (Primary Purposing Primary Screening) 19Q4 Tool. 9 genes from 402 genes, SGPL1, CXCR6, ATXN2L, LAMP3, RTN3, BTN2A1, FOXM1, NQO1, and L1TD1 in 1826 cancer cell line showed statistical sensitivity to metformin. This in-silico study showed the sensitivity of specific cancer cell lines to metformin. Therefore, holding promises for metformin and tumor-targeted treatment strategies. It is recommended, however, to conduct further research into its potential effectiveness and mechanism of action.",

Although metformin has been shown to improve HRQOL in PCOS patients, it is unclear whether this effect is due to the drug itself or its metabolic benefits. This study included 66 PCOS patients from the University Medical Center Mainz, in two groups: 31 received metformin (M-group) and 35 received alternative or no treatment (C-group). HRQOL and distress were assessed at baseline and after 6 months using the Modified PCOS-Questionnaire (MPCOSQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). At baseline, the M-group had significantly worse metabolic markers, including HOMA-IR, waist circumference, Visceral Adiposity Index, and Fatty Liver Index. By follow-up, this group showed greater improvements in these markers. However, both groups improved similarly in HRQOL and distress. Regression analysis revealed that improvements in HOMA-IR and BMI were associated with better HRQOL scores. Group assignment was not a significant predictor. These findings may indicate that improvements in HRQOL and reduced distress are linked to metabolic changes associated with metformin use, underscoring the potential relevance of addressing metabolic health in treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a significant hallmark of cancer that promotes chemoresistance by allowing tumor tissues to adapt to changes in the tumor microenvironment caused by anticancer therapies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common types of primary tumors, is associated with recurrent metabolic reprogramming that maximizes cancer cell growth and proliferation. Herein, we developed metformin (MET)-loaded hyaluronic acid (HA)-derived carbon dots (HA-CD-MET) by a simple and green method with no involvement of any additives. HA-CD-MET was utilized for specifically binding the CD44 receptor overexpressed in HCC and induced glutamine metabolic rewiring to inhibit HCC cell proliferation. Exposure to HA-CD-MET resulted in ∼6.5-fold better anticancer efficacy against CD44<sup>+</sup> Hep3B cells in comparison to CD44<sup>-</sup>, HepG2, and noncancerous HEK293 cells at a very low dose of 80 μg/mL. Moreover, treatment of three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid model of HCC (Hep3B) with HA-CD-MET resulted in ∼4.9-fold reduction in tumor size. This improved anticancer efficacy of HA-CD-MET was attributed to the inhibition of glutaminase-1 (GLS-1), a mitochondrial enzyme that hydrolyzes glutamine into glutamate as confirmed from immunofluorescence and immunoblotting experiments. Furthermore, treatment with HA-CD-MET resulted in downregulation of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) in Hep3B cells. Consequently, cancer cells were starved from essential nutrients, glutamine, and glucose, leading to the enhancement in intracellular ROS generation. This increase in intracellular ROS accumulation activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited AKT phosphorylation, leading to cancer cell apoptosis. Thus, this study offers the targeting of metabolic reprogramming by HA-CD-MET that opens up a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in hepatocarcinoma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate whether PP2A activation is involved in the anti-cancer activity of metformin. MATERIAL AND METHODS A549 and H1651 human lung cancer cells were constructed with stable a4 overexpression (O/E α4) or knockdown of PP2A catalytic subunit A/B(sh-PP2Ac). Influences of okadaic acid (OA) treatment, O/E α4 or sh-PP2Ac on metformin treated cells were investigated by cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and Transwell invasion assay in vitro. Protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Myc, and Akt as well as serine phosphorylation level of Bax, Myc, and Akt were examined by western blot. For in vivo assays, wild type (WT) or modified A549 cells were subcutaneously injected in nude mice, and metformin treatment on these xenografted tumors were assayed by tumor formation assay and western blot detecting cell proliferation marker PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) as well as protein expression level and serine phosphorylation level of Akt and Myc. RESULTS Metformin treatment significantly reduced A549 or H1651 cell growth and invasive capacity in vitro as well as Ser184 phosphorylation of Bax, Ser62 phosphorylation of Myc, and Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, all of which could be partially attenuated by OA treatment, O/E α4 or sh-PP2Ac. Metformin treatment also significantly reduced tumor formation in vivo as well as protein expression of PCNA, Akt, Myc, and serine phosphorylation of the latter 2, which can be partially blocked by O/E α4 or sh-PP2Ac. CONCLUSIONS Metformin reduced lung cancer cell growth and invasion in vitro as well as tumor formation in vivo partially by activating PP2A.",

      "abstract": "Metformin (MET) can effectively treat endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and the expression of glucose transporter type 4 insulin‑responsive (GLUT4) is closely associated with the development of EH. The present study aimed to verify the effect of MET in functional EH and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). H&E staining was performed to analyze the severity of EH, and immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of GLUT4 in the endometrium of PCOS rats. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was used to calculate the expression of long non‑coding (lnc)RNA‑maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), lncRNA‑small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20), GLUT4 mRNA, microRNA (miR)‑223 and miR‑4486. Sequence analysis and luciferase assays were performed to explore the regulatory relationship among certain lncRNAs, miRNAs and target genes. EH in PCOS rats was efficiently inhibited by MET administration. The increased expression of GLUT4 in PCOS rats was attenuated by MET treatment. Moreover, the expression levels of lncRNA‑MEG3 and lncRNA‑SNHG20 were significantly inhibited in the endometrium of PCOS rats. MET treatment also showed remarkable efficiency in restoring the expression of lncRNA‑MEG3 and lncRNA‑SNHG20. Meanwhile, the expression levels of miR‑223 and miR‑4486 were notably elevated in the endometrium of PCOS rats, while MET treatment reduced the expression of miR‑223 and miR‑4486 in PCOS rats. Furthermore, a luciferase assay confirmed the inhibitory relationship between miR‑223 and lncRNA‑MEG3/GLUT4 expression, as well as between miR‑4486 and lncRNA‑SNHG20/GLUT4 expression. GLUT4 knockdown restored the decreased viability of HCC‑94 cells induced by overexpression of lncRNA‑MEG3. To conclude, MET exhibited a therapeutic effect in the treatment of EH by modulating the lncRNA‑MEG3/miR‑223/GLUT4 and lncRNA‑SNHG20/miR‑4486/GLUT4 signaling pathways. This work provides mechanistic insight into the development of EH.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether type 2 diabetes mellitus and treatment with metformin is associated with prostate cancer risk. The cohort was composed of diabetic male patients identified in the National Health Insurance Fund database during 2000-2016 and cancer cases in national Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for prostate cancers as a ratio of observed number of cancer case in people with diagnosis of diabetes to the expected number of cancer cases in the underlying general population. 2754 prostate cancers were observed versus 3111.26 expected within the period of observation entailing an SIR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.92). Significantly lower risk of prostate cancer was found in diabetes patients in all age groups, also was in metformin-users and never-users' groups, with higher risk reduction in metformin-users (SIR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.68-0.75) than in diabetes patients never-users (SIR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96). In this large population-based study, we found a significantly decreased risk of prostate cancer among men with diabetes and metformin-users.",

We conducted a comprehensive study to assess the effectiveness of metformin and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), whether autologous or allogeneic, individually or in combination therapy, in mitigating RISF. Using a female C57BL/6J mouse model subjected to hind limb irradiation as a representative RISF model, we evaluated metformin, ASCs, or their combination in two contexts: prophylactic (started on day 1 post-irradiation) and therapeutic (initiated on day 14 post-irradiation, coinciding with fibrosis symptoms). We measured limb movement, examined skin histology, and analyzed gene expression to assess treatment efficacy. Prophylactic metformin and ASCs, whether autologous or allogeneic, effectively prevented late fibrosis, with metformin showing promising results. However, combination therapy did not provide additional benefits when used prophylactically. Autologous ASCs, alone or with metformin, proved most effective against late-stage RISF. Prophylactic intervention outperformed late therapy for mitigating radiation skin damage. Co-culture studies revealed that ASCs and metformin downregulated inflammation and fibrotic gene expression in both mouse and human fibroblasts. Our study suggests metformin's potential as a prophylactic measure to prevent RISF, and the combination of ASCs and metformin holds promise for late-stage RISF treatment. These findings have clinical implications for improving the quality of life for those affected by radiation-induced skin fibrosis.",

This study is to investigate the use of aspirin, metformin, or the combination of both is associated with delayed cancer incidence. This dataset is based on the electronic medical record of public hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were classified into 1. aspirin user, 2. metformin user, 3. both aspirin and metformin user and 4. control group with neither aspirin nor metformin used. Aspirin and/or metformin must have been taken for over 6 months in the treatment group and cancer incidences was counted at least 6 months after exposure to such medications. The primary outcome of this study was overall incidence of cancer during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were cancer incidences of specific sites, including colon/rectum, liver, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach, lung, breast, kidney, bladder and prostate. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios of cancer risks. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for the medication effects. A total of 120,971 aspirin users, 11,365 metformin users, and 6630 aspirin plus metformin users, were identified. Compare to the control groups, those who used aspirin alone demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87). Similarly, those who used metformin alone also showed an overall reduction in cancer risk (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88). Patients who received both aspirin and metformin showed the most significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.63). Metformin showed a significant reduction in cancer risk of lung, oesophagus and bladder. There is a similar decrease in overall cancer rate with the use of aspirin or metformin alone. A more significant reduction in overall cancer risk was found with the use of both agents.",

In this sub-analysis of the ARON-2 real-world study (NCT05290038), we aimed to assess the impact of concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), statins, or metformin on outcome of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) receiving second-line pembrolizumab. We collected data from the hospital medical records of patients with mUC treated with pembrolizumab as second-line therapy at 87 institutions from 22 countries. Patients were assessed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate. We carried out a survival analysis by a Cox regression model. A total of 802 patients were eligible for this retrospective study; the median follow-up time was 15.3 months. PPI users compared to non-users showed inferior PFS (4.5 vs. 7.2 months, p = 0.002) and OS (8.7 vs. 14.1 months, p < 0.001). Concomitant PPI use remained a significant predictor of PFS and OS after multivariate Cox analysis. The use of statins or metformin was not associated with response or survival. Our study results suggest a significant prognostic impact of concomitant PPI use in mUC patients receiving pembrolizumab in the real-world context. The mechanism of this interaction warrants further elucidation.",

We examined the hypotheses that survival after a diagnosis of solid-tumor cancer is reduced in those with diabetes when compared with those without diabetes, and that treatment with metformin influences survival after cancer diagnosis. Data were obtained from >350 U.K. primary care practices in a retrospective cohort study. All individuals with or without diabetes who developed a first tumor after January 1990 were identified and records were followed to December 2009. Diabetes was further stratified by treatment regimen. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare all-cause mortality from all cancers and from specific cancers. Of 112,408 eligible individuals, 8,392 (7.5%) had type 2 diabetes. Cancer mortality was increased in those with diabetes, compared with those without (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 1.06-1.13]). Mortality was increased in those with breast (1.32 [1.17-1.49]) and prostate cancer (1.19 [1.08-1.31]) but decreased in lung cancer (0.84 [0.77-0.92]). When analyzed by diabetes therapy, mortality was increased relative to nondiabetes in those on monotherapy with sulfonylureas (1.13 [1.05-1.21]) or insulin (1.13 [1.01-1.27]) but reduced in those on metformin monotherapy (0.85 [0.78-0.93]). This study confirmed that type 2 diabetes was associated with poorer prognosis after incident cancer, but that the association varied according to diabetes therapy and cancer site. Metformin was associated with survival benefit both in comparison with other treatments for diabetes and in comparison with a nondiabetic population.",

To reduce side effects and enhance chemosensitivity are urgently needed. We synthesized a drug delivery system (named CECMa NPs) based on cisplatin (CDDP) and metformin (chemotherapeutic sensitizer), of which chlorin e6 (Ce6) and polyethylene glycol diamine (PEG) were synthesized as the shell, an anti-LDLR antibody (which can target to hypoxic tumor cells) was modified on the surface to achieve tumor targeting. The NPs possessed a great synergistic effect of chemotherapy and phototherapy. After laser stimulation, both CDDP and metformin can be released in situ to achieve anti-tumor effects. Meanwhile, PDT and PTT triggered by a laser have anticancer effects. Furthermore, compared with free cisplatin, CECMa exhibits less systemic toxicity with laser irradiation in the xenograft mouse tumor model. CECMa effectively destroyed the tumors via hypoxia targeting multimodal therapy both in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing a novel strategy for targeting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

      "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) contains a subset of exclusively tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) which have been shown to drive tumor initiation, metastasis and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Here we describe a specific methodology for culturing primary human pancreatic CSCs as tumor spheres in anchorage-independent conditions. Cells are grown in serum-free, non-adherent conditions in order to enrich for CSCs while their more differentiated progenies do not survive and proliferate during the initial phase following seeding of single cells. This assay can be used to estimate the percentage of CSCs present in a population of tumor cells. Both size (which can range from 35 to 250 micrometers) and number of tumor spheres formed represents CSC activity harbored in either bulk populations of cultured cancer cells or freshly harvested and digested tumors. Using this assay, we recently found that metformin selectively ablates pancreatic CSCs; a finding that was subsequently further corroborated by demonstrating diminished expression of pluripotency-associated genes/surface markers and reduced in vivo tumorigenicity of metformin-treated cells. As the final step for preclinical development we treated mice bearing established tumors with metformin and found significantly prolonged survival. Clinical studies testing the use of metformin in patients with PDAC are currently underway (e.g., NCT01210911, NCT01167738, and NCT01488552). Mechanistically, we found that metformin induces a fatal energy crisis in CSCs by enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reducing mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In contrast, non-CSCs were not eliminated by metformin treatment, but rather underwent reversible cell cycle arrest. Therefore, our study serves as a successful example for the potential of in vitro sphere formation as a screening tool to identify compounds that potentially target CSCs, but this technique will require further in vitro and in vivo validation to eliminate false discoveries.",

We compared cancer risk among the subjects who had no diabetes, had type 2 diabetes but were not on diabetes drugs, used metformin only, used antidiabetic drugs other than metformin, or used metformin in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. Our results revealed dose-dependent effects of metformin on cancer risk and cancer onset times. A significant decrease in cancer risk was found in the monotherapy group who received more than 360 defined daily doses (DDDs) of metformin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.66). The greatest decrease in cancer risk was observed in patients who took more than 1080 DDDs (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.84). Significantly greater dose-dependent effects were seen in patients who used metformin in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. The magnitude of cancer risk reduction and prolonged cancer onset times produced by metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes depended on the dose of metformin, regardless of whether metformin was used alone or combined with other antidiabetic drugs.",

Angiogenic ECs are phenotypically similar, while other EC subtypes are different. Predictive interactome analysis reveals known but also previously unreported receptor-ligand interactions between ECs and immune cells, suggesting an involvement of breast EC subtypes in immune responses. We also identify a capillary EC subtype (LIPEC (Lipid Processing EC)), which expresses genes involved in lipid processing that are regulated by PPAR-γ and is more abundant in peri-tumoral breast tissue. Retrospective analysis of 4648 BC patients reveals that treatment with metformin (an indirect PPAR-γ signaling activator) provides long-lasting clinical benefit and is positively associated with LIPEC abundance. Our findings warrant further exploration of this LIPEC/PPAR-γ link for BC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (diabetic MASLD) frequently coexist and worsen liver and non-liver outcomes, but effective pharmacological therapies are limited. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) on liver and non-liver outcomes among patients with diabetic MASLD. This population-based cohort study retrieved patients with diabetic MASLD from Merative Marketscan Research Databases (April 2013 and December 2021). The active comparator was other glucose-lowering drugs (oGLDs). Primary outcomes were liver complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis, as well as non-liver complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and non-liver cancer. Propensity score matching was applied and Cox regression models were conducted. Compared with oGLD, SGLT-2i users had significantly lower risk of HCC (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93), liver cirrhosis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.84), CVD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.85) and CKD (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.70), non-liver cancer (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86). Compared with patients without metformin and SGLT-2i, a stepwise decreasing risk was observed in users of either metformin or SGLT-2i (HRs 0.76-0.97) and in users of both medications (HRs 0.58-0.79). The lower risk also was shown in liver decompensation, compensated cirrhosis, major CVD, end-stage renal disease and specific common cancers (HRs 0.61-0.84). In a nationwide cohort, SGLT-2i users were associated with a substantially lower risk of liver and non-liver complications than oGLD users among patients with diabetic MASLD. The risk was further reduced with concomitant metformin use.",

      "abstract": "Thirteen human malignant neoplasms have been identified as obesity-associated cancers (OACs), ie, the presence of excess body fat is associated with increased risk of developing cancer and worse prognosis in patients with these specific tumors. The glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class of pharmaceuticals are effective agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and for achieving weight loss, but the association of GLP-1RAs with the incident risk of 13 OACs is unclear. To compare the incident risk of each of the 13 OACs in patients with T2D who were prescribed GLP-1RAs vs insulins or metformin. This retrospective cohort study was based on a nationwide multicenter database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 113 million US patients. The study population included 1 651 452 patients with T2D who had no prior diagnosis of OACs and were prescribed GLP-1RAs, insulins, or metformin during March 2005 to November 2018. Data analysis was conducted on April 26, 2024. Prescription of GLP-1RAs, insulins, or metformin. Incident (first-time) diagnosis of each of the 13 OACs occurring during a 15-year follow-up after the exposure was examined using Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with censoring applied. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and 95% CIs were calculated. All models were adjusted for confounders at baseline by propensity-score matching baseline covariates. In the study population of 1 651 452 patients with T2D (mean [SD] age, 59.8 [15.1] years; 827 873 [50.1%] male and 775 687 [47.0%] female participants; 5780 [0.4%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 65 893 [4.0%] Asian, 281 242 [17.0%] Black, 13 707 [0.8%] Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 1 000 780 [60.6%] White participants), GLP-1RAs compared with insulin were associated with a significant risk reduction in 10 of 13 OACs, including in gallbladder cancer (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83), meningioma (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.74), pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.33-0.50), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.61), ovarian cancer (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74), colorectal cancer (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.64), multiple myeloma (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77), esophageal cancer (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86), endometrial cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91), and kidney cancer (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91). Although not statistically significant, the HR for stomach cancer was less than 1 among patients who took GLP-1RAs compared with those who took insulin (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.03). GLP-1RAs were not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer or thyroid cancer. Of those cancers that showed a decreased risk among patients taking GLP-1RAs compared with those taking insulin, HRs for patients taking GLP-1RAs vs those taking metformin for colorectal and gallbladder cancer were less than 1, but the risk reduction was not statistically significant. Compared with metformin, GLP-1RAs were not associated with a decreased risk of any cancers, but were associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27-1.87). In this study, GLP-1RAs were associated with lower risks of specific types of OACs compared with insulins or metformin in patients with T2D. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies for the prevention of certain OACs.",

      "abstract": "Withdrawal of semaglutide is frequently followed by weight regain due to compensatory biological changes that prevent the maintenance of long-term weight loss. There are some studies implying that metformin might attenuate weight regain. The weight trajectory after discontinuation of short-term semaglutide treatment in obese women with PCOS who continued metformin treatment has not yet been evaluated. We explored changes in body weight, cardiometabolic and endocrine parameters in obese women with PCOS who continued treatment with metformin 2 years after discontinuation of short-term intervention with semaglutide. 25 women with PCOS and obesity, aged 33.7 ± 5.3 years (mean ± SD), were treated with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg as an adjunct to metformin 2000 mg/day and lifestyle intervention for 16 weeks. At week 16, semaglutide was discontinued. Treatment with metformin 2000 mg/day and promotion of lifestyle intervention were continued during the 2-year follow-up period. Weight change, cardiometabolic, and endocrine parameters were assessed 2 years after semaglutide discontinuation. During semaglutide treatment phase, weight decreased from 101 (90-106.8) kg to 92 (83.3-100.8) kg. Two years after semaglutide withdrawal, weight was 95 (77-104) kg. The net weight loss 2 years after discontinuation of semaglutide remained significant when compared to baseline (p=0.003). At the end of the study, 21 out of 25 subjects had lower body weight compared to baseline. Improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including decrease in total and LDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and glucose after OGTT that had been seen during semaglutide-treatment phase reverted towards baseline two years after semaglutide cessation. Free testosterone levels significantly decreased during semaglutide treatment from 6.16 (4.07-9.71) to 4.12 (2.98-6.93) nmol/l, (p= 0.012) and did not significantly deteriorate after semaglutide discontinuation. Two years after semaglutide withdrawal, women with PCOS who continued with metformin regained about one-third of the semaglutide-induced weight loss. At the end of the follow up, 84% of women had a lower body weight than at baseline.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most devastating and incurable cancers due to its aggressive behaviour and lack of available therapies, being its overall-survival from diagnosis ∼14-months. Thus, identification of new therapeutic tools is urgently needed. Interestingly, metabolism-related drugs (e.g., metformin/statins) are emerging as efficient antitumour agents for several cancers. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro/in vivo effects of metformin and/or statins on key clinical/functional/molecular/signalling parameters in glioblastoma patients/cells. An exploratory-observational-randomized retrospective glioblastoma patient cohort (n = 85), human glioblastoma/non-tumour brain human cells (cell lines/patient-derived cell cultures), mouse astrocytes progenitor cell cultures, and a preclinical xenograft glioblastoma mouse model were used to measure key functional parameters, signalling-pathways and/or antitumour progression in response to metformin and/or simvastatin. Metformin and simvastatin exerted strong antitumour actions in glioblastoma cell cultures (i.e., proliferation/migration/tumoursphere/colony-formation/VEGF-secretion inhibition and apoptosis/senescence induction). Notably, their combination additively altered these functional parameters vs. individual treatments. These actions were mediated by the modulation of key oncogenic signalling-pathways (i.e., AKT/JAK-STAT/NF-κB/TGFβ-pathways). Interestingly, an enrichment analysis uncovered a TGFβ-pathway activation, together with AKT inactivation, in response to metformin + simvastatin combination, which might be linked to an induction of the senescence-state, the associated secretory-phenotype, and to the dysregulation of spliceosome components. Remarkably, the antitumour actions of metformin + simvastatin combination were also observed in vivo [i.e., association with longer overall-survival in human, and reduction in tumour-progression in a mouse model (reduced tumour-size/weight/mitosis-number, and increased apoptosis)]. Altogether, metformin and simvastatin reduce aggressiveness features in glioblastomas, being this effect significantly more effective (in vitro/in vivo) when both drugs are combined, offering a clinically relevant opportunity that should be tested for their use in humans.

      "abstract": "In retrospective studies, metformin use has been associated with better clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs). However, prospective evidence of metformin safety and activity is lacking. Here, we conducted the first-in-human phase Ib MetNET2 trial to investigate the safety and antitumor activity of metformin in combination with the somatostatin analog lanreotide autogel (ATG) in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with advanced WDNETs of the gastrointestinal (GI) or thoracic tract. Enrolled patients received lanreotide ATG 120 mg plus oral metformin, up to a maximum dosage of 2550 mg/day. We enrolled 20 patients, of whom 18 (90%) and 2 (10%) had WDNETs of the GI and thoracic tract, respectively. Fourteen patients (70%) were non-diabetic. With a 5% incidence of SAEs, the study met its primary objective of demonstrating treatment safety. With a median follow-up of 39 months (95% CI 28-NE), median PFS was 24 months (95% CI 16-NE), with 12-month and 24-month PFS probability of 75% (95% CI 58-97) and 49% (95% CI 31-77), respectively. We found no statistically significant PFS differences between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Among exploratory analyses, the presence of tumor genomic alterations in DNA damage pathways was associated with trend towards worse PFS, whereas a precocious reduction of HOMA-IR index and plasma cholesterol concentration showed a trend towards an association with better PFS. In conclusion, metformin plus lanreotide ATG is a safe and well tolerated combination treatment that is associated with promising antitumor activity in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients with WDNETs, and that warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "In the USA, the prolonged effective survival of cancer population has brought significant attention to the rising risk of cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in this population. This heightened risk underscores the urgent need for research into effective pharmacological interventions for cancer survivors. Notably, metformin, a well-known metabolic regulator with pleiotropic effects, has shown protective effects against cardiometabolic disorders in diabetic individuals. Despite these promising indications, evidence supporting its efficacy in improving cardiometabolic outcomes in cancer survivors remains scarce. A prospective cohort was established using a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors enrolled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), spanning 2003 to 2018. Outcomes were derived from patient interviews, physical examinations, and public-access linked mortality archives up to 2019. The Oxidative Balance Score was utilized to assess participants' levels of oxidative stress. To evaluate the correlations between metformin use and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and related mortality, survival analysis of cardiometabolic mortality was performed by Cox proportional hazards model, and cross-sectional analysis of cardiometabolic diseases outcomes was performed using logistic regression models. Interaction analyses were conducted to explore the specific pharmacological mechanism of metformin. Among 3995 cancer survivors (weighted population, 21,671,061, weighted mean [SE] age, 62.62 [0.33] years; 2119 [53.04%] females; 2727 [68.26%] Non-Hispanic White individuals), 448 reported metformin usage. During the follow-up period of up to 17 years (median, 6.42 years), there were 1233 recorded deaths, including 481 deaths from cardiometabolic causes. Multivariable models indicated that metformin use was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.81) and cardiometabolic (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.97) mortality compared with metformin nonusers. Metformin use was also correlated with a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28-0.59), stroke (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74), hypertension (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52), and coronary heart disease (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.78). The observed inverse associations were consistent across subgroup analyses in four specific cancer populations identified as cardiometabolic high-risk groups. Interaction analyses suggested that metformin use as compared to non-use may counter-balance oxidative stress. In this cohort study involving a nationally representative population of US cancer survivors, metformin use was significantly correlated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic diseases, all-cause mortality, and cardiometabolic mortality.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder that impacts both the endocrine and metabolic systems, often resulting in infertility, obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of intestinal flora and its metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in the development of PCOS, and to assess the effects of metformin therapy on these components. SCFA levels in fecal and blood samples from women with PCOS (n=69) and healthy controls (n=18) were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) for precise measurement. Fecal microbiota were quantitatively detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To assess the efficacy of six months of metformin treatment, changes in the microbiota and SCFAs in the PCOS group (n=69) were also evaluated. The results revealed that women with PCOS exhibited a significant reduction in beneficial bacteria (namely, the <i>C. leptum</i> group and <i>Prevotella</i> spp.) alongside a notable overgrowth of opportunistic microorganisms (<i>C. perfringens</i>, <i>C. difficile</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp., and <i>Streptococcus</i> spp.). An overproduction of acetic acid (AA, FC=0.47, p<0.05) and valeric acid (VA, FC=0.54, p<0.05) suggests a link between elevated SCFAs and the development of obesity and PCOS. Interestingly, AA in the bloodstream might offer a protective effect against PCOS by ameliorating key symptoms such as high body mass index (r=-0.33, p=0.02), insulin resistance (r=-0.39, p=0.02), and chronic inflammation. Although serum SCFA levels showed non-significant changes following metformin treatment (p>0.05), the normalization of AA in the gut underscores that metformin exerts a more pronounced effect locally within the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the study identified the most effective model for predicting the success of metformin therapy, based on serum concentrations of butyric acid (BA) and VA, achieving a 91% accuracy rate, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. These promising findings highlight the potential for developing targeted interventions and personalized treatments, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for women with PCOS.",

This population-based cohort study included new cases of esophageal cancer reported in Sweden from 2006 to 2018 with follow-up through 2019. Diabetes status and metformin use were analyzed in relation to all-cause and disease-specific mortality using multivariable Cox regression. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, obesity, comorbidity, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or statins. For comparison reasons, 3 other antidiabetic medications were also analyzed (ie, sulfonylureas, insulin, and thiazolidinedione). Among 4851 esophageal cancer patients (8404 person-years), 4072 (84%) died during follow-up. Compared with esophageal cancer patients with diabetes but not using metformin, decreased all-cause mortality was indicated among nondiabetic patients (without metformin) (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77 to 0.96) and diabetic patients who used metformin (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.00). The hazard ratios of all-cause mortality decreased with a higher daily dose of metformin (Ptrend = .04). The corresponding hazard ratios for disease-specific mortality were similar but slightly attenuated. The results were also similar in separate analyses of esophageal cancer patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, with tumor stage I-II or III-IV, and in those who had or had not undergone surgery. No associations with mortality outcomes were found for use of sulfonylureas, insulin, or thiazolidinedione. Diabetes was associated with an increased all-cause mortality, whereas metformin use was associated with decreased all-cause mortality among esophageal cancer patients. More research is needed to determine if metformin affects survival in esophageal cancer.",

Sixty normal-weight women with PCOS were recruited between January and September 2022 at the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. They were randomly assigned to the MET or PIOMET groups for 12 weeks of MET monotherapy or PIOMET therapy. Anthropometric measurements, menstrual cycle changes, gonadal profiles, and the oral glucose insulin-releasing test (OGIRT) were performed at baseline and after the 12-week treatment. Thirty-six participants completed the trial. MET and PIOMET therapies improved menstrual cycles after the 4- and 12-week treatments; however, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. PIOMET therapy improved luteinizing hormone (LH), luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio, and free androgen index (FAI) levels after the 4-week treatment, whereas MET monotherapy only improved total testosterone (TT) levels compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Both MET and PIOMET therapies improved TT and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels after the 12-week treatment (P < 0.05). In addition, only PIOMET therapy significantly improved sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), FAI, and androstenedione (AND) levels than the baseline (P < 0.05). PIOMET therapy improved SHBG and AMH levels more effectively than MET monotherapy (P < 0.05). Furthermore, PIOMET treatment was more effective in improving blood glucose levels at 120 and 180 min of OGIRT compared to MET monotherapy (P < 0.05). In normal-weight women with PCOS, PIOMET treatment may have more benefits in improving SHBG, AMH, and postprandial glucose levels than MET monotherapy, and did not affect weight. However, the study findings need to be confirmed in PCOS study populations with larger sample sizes.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and activity of metformin combined with nivolumab in diabetic cancer patients. Patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or lung cancer receiving nivolumab with concurrent diabetes treated with metformin were retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was the safety of nivolumab plus metformin combination. We collected 40 patients with solid tumors who received metformin for concomitant diabetes and nivolumab as anticancer therapy in four Italian Hospitals. The concomitant use of nivolumab and metformin was well tolerated; adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 75% of patients (mainly fatigue, pruritus, rash, and asthenia). Grade 3 AEs occurred only in 20% of cases; no grade 4 AEs were observed. A statistically significant correlation was found between higher doses of metformin (>1,000 mg daily) and longer progression-free survival (p=0.021), overall survival (p=0.037) and higher overall response rate. The combination of nivolumab and metformin was safe and might have an antitumor activity, supporting further investigations on the synergistic antitumor effect of this combination.",

While metformin has been associated with lower CRC risk in general diabetic populations, its effect in patients with coexisting IBD and diabetes-a group at compounded risk-remains unclear. We conducted a nationwide cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Among 241 590 adults newly diagnosed with IBD between 2008 and 2019, 1695 metformin users were matched to 1695 non-metformin users after applying strict eligibility criteria and 1:1 propensity score matching. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for incident CRC and all-cause mortality were estimated using time-dependent Cox models and Fine-Gray competing risk analysis. Dose-response was assessed via restricted cubic splines. Metformin use was associated with a 56% lower risk of CRC (aHR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.68), with similar findings in competing risk models (subdistribution HR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.76). All-cause mortality was reduced by 32% (aHR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.80). CRC risk decreased with higher cumulative exposure; those in the highest quartile had a 67% lower risk (aHR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.57). The lowest CRC risk occurred at ∼0.4 defined daily dose/day (∼800 mg/day). Metformin use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in patients with IBD. These findings suggest a potential chemopreventive role, but confirmation from prospective randomized studies is needed before drawing causal inferences.",

Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic drug, but not other anti-diabetic drugs, has been associated with reduced risk of breast and of colon cancers in some, but not in other, studies. Data from two large-scale, population-based, case-control studies of breast and colorectal cancers etiology, conducted in Northern Israel since 1998 were analyzed to evaluate the association between regular use (>3 times) of metformin prior to diagnosis and risk of developing cancer. The multivariate analyses for both cancer sites included age, family history of breast/colorectal cancer, history of diabetes, sports participation, fruits/vegetables consumption, aspirin and statins use, and for breast cancer, also included use of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormones and number of pregnancies. Use of metformin and diabetes status were determined based on valid electronic medical records of the participants. Metformin use prior to diagnosis of cancer was associated with a decrease in risk of both breast cancer (OR = 0.821, 0.726-0.928, p = 0.002) and colorectal cancer (OR = 0.754, 0.623-0.912, p = 0.004). An inverse association was not identified with use of other anti-diabetic medications. Diabetes was found to be associated with risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.204, 1.014-1.431, p = 0.034) but not of breast cancer. No dose response by years of use of metformin was found. These analyses of large population-based studies provide evidence of a strong inverse association of metformin with breast and, even more so, with colorectal cancer risk.",

      "abstract": "The antidiabetic drug metformin has known anticancer effects related to its antioxidant activity; however, its clinical benefit for prostate cancer (PCa) has thus far been inconclusive. Here, we investigate whether the efficacy of metformin in PCa is related to the expression status of NKX3.1, a prostate-specific homeobox gene that functions in mitochondria to protect the prostate from aberrant oxidative stress. To investigate the relationship of NKX3.1 expression and metformin efficacy in PCa. Functional studies were performed in vivo and in vitro in genetically engineered mouse models and human LNCaP cells, and organotypic cultures having normal or reduced/absent levels of NKX3.1. Correlative studies were performed using two independent retrospective tissue microarray cohorts of radical prostatectomies and a retrospective cohort of prostate biopsies from patients on active surveillance. Metformin was administered before or after the induction of oxidative stress by treatment with paraquat. Functional endpoints included analyses of histopathology, tumorigenicity, and mitochondrial function. Correlative endpoints include Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Metformin reversed the adverse consequences of NKX3.1 deficiency following oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, as evident by reduced tumorigenicity and restored mitochondrial function. Patients with low NKX3.1 expression showed a significant clinical benefit from taking metformin. Metformin can overcome the adverse consequences of NKX3.1 loss for PCa progression by protecting against oxidative stress and promoting normal mitochondrial function. These functional activities and clinical correlates were observed only with low NKX3.1 expression. Thus, the clinical benefit of metformin in PCa may depend on the status of NKX3.1 expression. Prostate cancer patients with low NKX3.1 are likely to benefit most from metformin treatment to delay disease progression in a precision interception paradigm.",

We investigated combination anti-hyperglycemic therapy in a mouse model of GBM and evaluated the association of glycemic control in clinical trial data from patients with GBM. The effect of the anti-hyperglycemic regimens, metformin and the ketogenic diet, was evaluated in combination with PI3K inhibition in patient-derived GBM cells and in an orthotopic GBM mouse model. Insulin feedback and the immune microenvironment were retrospectively evaluated in blood and tumor tissue from a Phase 2 clinical trial of buparlisib in patients with recurrent GBM. We found that PI3K inhibition induces hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in mice and that combining metformin with PI3K inhibition improves the treatment efficacy in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model. Through examination of clinical trial data, we found that hyperglycemia was an independent factor associated with poor progression-free survival in patients with GBM. We also found that PI3K inhibition increased insulin receptor activation and T-cell and microglia abundance in tumor tissue from these patients. Reducing insulin feedback improves the efficacy of PI3K inhibition in GBM in mice, and hyperglycemia worsens progression-free survival in patients with GBM treated with PI3K inhibition. These findings indicate that hyperglycemia is a critical resistance mechanism associated with PI3K inhibition in GBM and that anti-hyperglycemic therapy may enhance PI3K inhibitor efficacy in GBM patients.",

This study included newly diagnosed lung cancer patients (identified from English National Cancer Data Repository, 1998-2009) with type 2 diabetes (based on UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink prescriptions and diagnosis records). Lung cancer deaths occurring up to 2012 were identified using Office of National Statistics mortality data and the association between metformin use (before and after diagnosis) and risk of lung cancer-specific mortality was calculated using Cox regression models. In analysis of 533 patients, we found a weak non-significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality with metformin use after diagnosis (adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68-1.09). No association was evident for metformin use before diagnosis and cancer-specific mortality in analysis of 1350 patients (adjusted HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86, 1.11). Associations were similar by duration of use. In addition, after adjustment for potential confounders, there was little evidence of an association between the use of other anti-diabetic medications (either before or after diagnosis) and lung cancer-specific mortality; including sulfonylureas, insulin or other anti-diabetic medications (such as thiazolidinediones). Overall, the results from this population-based study provide little evidence of a protective association between metformin use and cancer mortality in lung cancer patients.",

Metformin has been used in an attempt to improve pregnancy outcomes. Our study aims to explore childbirth experiences in women with PCOS compared with a reference population. It also explores the potential influence of metformin, obesity, pregnancy complications, and the duration and mode of birth on childbirth experiences. This study is a cohort study combining data from two randomized trials conducted in Norway, Sweden and Iceland. The PregMet2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01587378) investigated the use of metformin vs. placebo in pregnant women with PCOS. The Labour Progression Study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02221427) compared the WHO partograph to Zhang's guidelines for progression of labor and were used as the reference population. A total of 365 women with PCOS and 3604 reference women were included. Both studies used the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Main outcome measures were total CEQ score and four domain scores. The CEQ scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U test for women in Robson group 1 with PCOS (n = 131) and reference women (n = 3604). CEQ scores were also compared between metformin-treated (n = 180) and placebo-treated (n = 185) women with PCOS, and for different subgroups of women with PCOS. There was no difference in total CEQ score between women with PCOS and reference women-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW)-odds 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-1.17). We detected no difference in CEQ scores between the metformin- and placebo-treated women with PCOS (WMW-odds 1.13, 95% CI 0.89-1.43). Complications in pregnancy did not affect CEQ (WMW-odds 1, 95% CI 0.76-1.31). Higher body mass index (WMW-odds 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96), longer duration of labor (WMW-odds 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96), and cesarean section (WMW-odds 0.29, 95% CI 0.2-0.42) were associated with lower CEQ scores in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS experience childbirth similarly to the reference women. Metformin did not influence childbirth experience in women with PCOS, neither did pregnancy complications. Obesity, long duration of labor or cesarean section had a negative impact on childbirth experience.",

We examined the association between metformin use and overall survival (OS) in patients with diabetes and colorectal cancer in a large population of U.S. veterans, while adjusting for measures of diabetic severity. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer from January 2001 to December 2008 were identified from the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry. Multivariable models were used to examine the adjusted association of OS with diabetes and use of antidiabetic medications. There were 21,352 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer identified (n = 16,355 nondiabetic patients, n = 2,038 diabetic patients on metformin, n = 2,136 diabetic patients on medications other than metformin, n = 823 diabetic patients not on antidiabetic medication). Diabetic patients had a significantly worse OS than nondiabetic patients, but metformin users had only a 10% increase in death (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17, P = 0.004), as compared with 22% for users of other antidiabetic medications (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29, P < 0.0001). Among colorectal cancer patients with diabetes, metformin users had a 13% improved OS versus patients taking other antidiabetic medications (HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95, P = 0.003), while diabetic patients not on any antidiabetic medications did not differ with respect to OS (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.02; 95% CI, 0.90-1.15, P = 0.76). Among diabetics with colorectal cancer, metformin use is associated with improved survival, despite adjustments for diabetes severity and other risk factors. These data lend further support to the conduct of randomized studies of possible anticancer effects of metformin among patients with colorectal cancer.

Disease management relies on glycemic control through diet, exercise, and pharmacological intervention. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of glycemic control and the use of glucose-lowering medication on the risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N=9486) between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2009 were identified and data on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, glucose), glucose-lowering medication use (insulin, metformin, sulfonylurea), age, BMI, date of diabetes diagnosis, insurance status, comorbidities, smoking history, location of residence, and cancer diagnoses were electronically abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the relationship between glycemic control, including medication use, and cancer risk. The results varied by cancer type and medication exposure. There was no association between glycemic control and breast or colon cancer; however, prostate cancer risk was significantly higher with better glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7.0%). Insulin use was associated with increased colon cancer incidence in women, but not with colon cancer in men or breast or prostate cancer risk. Metformin exposure was associated with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence, but had no association with colon cancer risk. Sulfonylurea exposure was not associated with risk of any type of cancer. The data reported here support hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, as a major diabetes-related factor associated with increased risk of breast and colon cancer. In contrast, hyperglycemia appears to be protective in the case of prostate cancer.",

This study identified diabetic adults with PCa receiving any ADT attending public hospitals in Hong Kong between December 1999 and March 2021 retrospectively, with follow-up until September 2021. Patients with <6 months of medical castration without subsequent bilateral orchidectomy, <6 months of concurrent metformin use and ADT, or missing baseline HbA1c were excluded. Metformin users had ≥180 days of concurrent metformin use and ADT, while non-users had no concurrent metformin use and ADT or never used metformin. The primary outcome was PCa-related mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. The study used inverse probability treatment weighting to balance covariates. The analyzed cohort consisted of 1971 patients (1284 metformin users and 687 non-users; mean age 76.2 ± 7.8 years). Over a mean follow-up of 4.1 ± 3.2 years, metformin users had significantly lower risks of PCa-related mortality (weighted hazard ratio [wHR]: 0.49 [95% confidence interval, CI:  0.39-0.61], p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (wHR 0.53 [0.46-0.61], p < 0.001), independent of diabetic control or status of chronic kidney disease. Such effects appeared stronger in patients with less advanced PCa, which is reflected by the absence of androgen receptor antagonist or chemotherapy use (p value for interaction: 0.017 for PCa-related mortality; 0.048 for all-cause mortality). Metformin use concurrent with ADT was associated with lower risks of mortality in Asian, diabetic patients with PCa.",

Hazard ratios of aspirin, statins, and metformin use for PC incidence and PC mortality were calculated with adjustment for simultaneous drug use. Cumulative use of each drug was inserted as time-dependent variable with 2-year time windows. Aspirin use ≥ 1.5 year (per 2-year) was associated with borderline decrease in PC mortality when compared to non-users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-1.02). Statins use was not associated with either PC incidence or PC mortality. Metformin ever-use was associated with decreased PC incidence compared with non-diabetics (aHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96). Diabetics who were not using metformin or using low cumulative doses had higher PC mortality than non-diabetics (aHR 2.01, 95% CI 1.44-2.81, and aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.07-2.69, respectively). However, subjects with higher cumulative doses of metformin did not show increased PC mortality. In conclusion, metformin use was associated with lower PC incidence.

This study aims to investigate the association between pre-diagnostic use of metformin and WLM with all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in older women with ORC. A retrospective cohort of 63,907 women (≥ 65 years) with ORC was identified using SEER-Medicare 2007-2015 data. Pre-diagnostic prescriptions of metformin and WLM were ascertained, and inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score (IPTW-PS) was utilized to balance baseline patient characteristics. Cox proportional hazards and competing-risks models were conducted. Metformin was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.86; 95% CI: 1.81-1.92) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.63-1.77). Likewise, WLM was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.64; 95% CI: 1.59-1.71) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.48-1.62). Dual use of metformin and WLM was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.39; 95% CI: 1.34-1.45) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21-1.53). Significant associations were observed in ORC subgroup analyses, except that WLM was inversely associated with ECa-specific morality. Pre-diagnostic metformin and WLM were associated with an increased mortality risk in older women with ORC, with effects more pronounced among metformin users. Further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these findings.",

      "abstract": "To examine the association between metformin use and mortality in patients with diabetes and cervical cancer. Using Ontario health databases, a retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted in women with diabetes ≥ age 66 years diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1997 and 2010. The association between metformin exposure and cervical cancer-specific mortality was examined using Fine-Gray regression models, with noncancer death as a competing risk and cumulative metformin use as a time-varying exposure. The association with overall mortality was examined using Cox regression models. Among the 181 women with diabetes and cervical cancer, there were 129 deaths, including 61 cervical cancer-specific deaths. The median follow-up was 5.8 years (interquartile range 4.2-9.6 years) for surviving patients. Cumulative dose of metformin after cervical cancer diagnosis was independently associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality in a dose-dependent fashion [HR 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.98; and HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.996 per each additional 365 g of metformin use, respectively]. There was no significant association between cumulative use of other antidiabetic drugs and cervical cancer-specific mortality. This study suggests an association between cumulative metformin use after cervical cancer diagnosis and lower cervical cancer-specific and overall mortality among older women with diabetes. Cumulative dose of metformin use after cervical cancer diagnosis among older women with diabetes may be associated with a significant decrease in mortality. This finding has important implications if validated prospectively, as metformin is inexpensive and can be easily combined with standard treatment for cervical cancer.",

      "abstract": "Few studies suggest that metformin decreases cancer mortality in type-2 diabetic patients (T2DP). We explored the association between the type and duration of antidiabetic therapies and cancer and other-than-cancer mortality in a T2DP cohort, taking into account the competing risks between different causes of death and multiple potential confounding effects. The mortality rates were compared with the general population from the same area. In 1995, all T2DP (n = 3685) at our diabetes clinic in Turin (∼12% of all T2DP in the city), without cancer at baseline, were identified. Vital status was assessed after a mean 4.5-year follow-up. Metformin users had greater adiposity, while insulin users had more co-morbidities. All-cause- and cancer-related deaths occurred in: 9.2 and 1.6% of metformin users, 13.1 and 3.0% of sulfonylureas users and 26.8 and 4.8% of insulin users, respectively. In a Cox regression model for competing risks, adjusted for propensity score, metformin users showed a lower cancer mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.94], while insulin was positively associated with other-than-cancer mortality (HR = 1.56; 95%CI 1.22-1.99). Each 5-year metformin exposure was associated with a reduction in cancer death by 0.73, whereas every 5-year insulin exposure was associated with 1.25-fold increase in other-than-cancer death. Standardized mortality ratios for cancer and other-than-cancer mortality in metformin users were 43.6 (95%CI 25.8-69.0) and 99.1 (95%CI 79.3-122.5), respectively, in comparison with the general population. Metformin users showed a lower risk of cancer-related mortality than not users or patients on diet only; this may represent another reason to choose metformin as a first-line therapy in T2DP.",

The impact of comedication on immunotherapy efficacy has been studied in retrospective series, but the results are often biased by the lack of information on the independent prognostic impact of comedication weighted for comorbidities and disease aggressiveness. The IFCT-1502 CLINIVO study is a nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received nivolumab in second or later lines of treatment as part of the French Expanded Access Program. We retrieved comedication prescriptions from 90 days before to 30 days after the first nivolumab administration via the French national healthcare database. We report the results of a comprehensive post hoc analysis investigating the impact of comedication on treatment response considering well-known negative prognostic factors. We selected 753 patients whose medical and comedication records were available. According to the multivariate analysis, morphine and corticosteroids > 20 mg per day were associated with poor overall survival regardless of disease aggressiveness. Conversely, metformin was associated with better overall survival. Morphine and corticosteroids were also found to be associated with shorter real-world progression-free survival according to multivariate analysis, as were poor prognostic factors such as liver metastasis and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score ≥ 2. Our study confirmed the negative impact of morphine and high-dose corticosteroids on immunotherapy efficacy regardless of poor prognostic factors related to disease aggressiveness. On the other hand, our findings suggested a positive impact of metformin on immunotherapy outcomes.",

Overall, 493,704 men and 502,139 women, covered by the National Health Insurance, without colon cancer were followed from 2003 to 2005. Cox regression evaluated the adjusted relative risk (RR), considering confounders and detection examinations. Even though diabetes patients had a significantly higher probability of receiving examinations that could lead to the detection of colon cancer, they had a significantly higher risk (24%) of this cancer after adjustment. Metformin users had a significantly lower risk (27%) of colon cancer. While comparing patients with diabetes for <1, 1-3, and ≥ 3 years to nondiabetes individuals, the adjusted RR (95% confidence interval) was 1.308 (1.020-1.679), 1.087 (0.900-1.313), and 1.185 (1.055-1.330) respectively. The higher risk among those with diabetes for <1 year suggested a possible reverse causality or a link with prediabetes. However, diabetes still might play some role in the development of colon cancer in those with diabetes for ≥ 3 years. The duration of metformin use showed an inverse trend, with a significant RR of 0.643 (0.490-0.845) in users for ≥ 3 years, when compared with nonusers. In addition, metformin may reduce colon cancer risk associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a surrogate for smoking). Following adjustment for potential detection bias and other covariates, diabetes remains a significant risk factor for colon cancer. Metformin may protect against colon cancer.",

      "abstract": "To evaluate the association between cumulative duration of metformin use after prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis and all-cause and PC-specific mortality among patients with diabetes. We used a population-based retrospective cohort design. Data were obtained from several Ontario health care administrative databases. Within a cohort of men older than age 66 years with incident diabetes who subsequently developed PC, we examined the effect of duration of antidiabetic medication exposure after PC diagnosis on all-cause and PC-specific mortality. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by using a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model to estimate effects. The cohort consisted of 3,837 patients. Median age at diagnosis of PC was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72 to 79 years). During a median follow-up of 4.64 years (IQR, 2.7 to 7.1 years), 1,343 (35%) died, and 291 patients (7.6%) died as a result of PC. Cumulative duration of metformin treatment after PC diagnosis was associated with a significant decreased risk of PC-specific and all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. Adjusted HR for PC-specific mortality was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89) for each additional 6 months of metformin use. The association with all-cause mortality was also significant but declined over time from an HR of 0.76 in the first 6 months to 0.93 between 24 and 30 months. There was no relationship between cumulative use of other antidiabetic drugs and either outcome. Increased cumulative duration of metformin exposure after PC diagnosis was associated with decreases in both all-cause and PC-specific mortality among diabetic men.",

Nationwide, nested case-control study. From a nationwide cohort of 264 708 individuals, we identified 1737 incident glaucoma cases and matched them to 8685 glaucoma-free controls, all aged more than 21 years and treated with metformin and a second-line antihyperglycemic drug formulation, with no history of glaucoma, eye trauma, or eye surgery. Cases were incidence-density-matched to 5 controls by birth year, sex, and date of second-line treatment initiation. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for glaucoma, defined by first-time diagnosis, first-time use of glaucoma-specific medication, or first-time glaucoma-specific surgical intervention. Compared with the reference group, who received treatments other than GLP-1RA, individuals who were exposed to GLP-1RA treatment exhibited a lower risk of incident glaucoma (HR, 0.81; CI, 0.70-0.94; P = 0.006). Prolonged treatment extending beyond 3 years lowered the risk even further (HR, 0.71; CI, 0.55-0.91; P = 0.007). Treatment with GLP-1RA for 0 to 1 year (HR, 0.89; CI, 0.70-1.14; P = 0.35) and 1 to 3 years (HR, 0.85; CI, 0.67-1.06; P = 0.15) was not significant. Exposure to GLP-1RA was associated with a lower risk of developing glaucoma compared with receiving other second-line antihyperglycemic medication.

MF is thought to work via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin and activation of p53 and liver kinase B1 via adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase. We investigated survival, recurrences and metastasis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) along with colorectal cancer (CC) or lung cancer (LC) taking MF using the electronic medical record in Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (colon, n = 202; lung, n = 180). Patients with CC or LC and DM2 on MF were compared to controls taking any medication except MF. Recurrences, metastases, secondary cancers, survival and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were compared using t test and chi-squared test. Inclusion criteria were based on MF use, CC or LC diagnosis and DM2. For CC, the MF group noted fewer deaths (48% versus 76%, P < 0.001), recurrences (4% versus 19%, P = 0.002), metastases (23% versus 46%, P = 0.001), better 5-year survival rates (57% versus 37%, P = 0.004), overall survival years (5.7 versus 4.1, P = 0.007) and greater carcinoembryonic antigen decrease (72% versus 47%, P = 0.015). MF was associated with improved 5-year survival rates (29% versus 15%, P = 0.023) and overall survival years (3.4 versus 1.8, P < 0.001) in LC. Our study shows that MF therapy is associated with significantly better prognosis in patients with CC and improved survival in LC. Patients with CC on MF had fewer recurrences and metastases. Differences in metabolic pathways between CC and LC likely account for the differences in the effect of MF.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a common disease marked by high blood sugars. An earlier clinical trial in type 1 diabetic subjects (T1Ds) found that repeat BCG vaccinations succeeded in lowering HbA1c values over a multi-year course. Here we seek to determine whether BCG therapy for bladder cancer may improve blood sugar levels in patients with comorbid T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigate whether BCG exposure may reduce onset of T1D and T2D by examining country-by-country impact of BCG childhood vaccination policies in relation to disease incidence. We first analyzed three large US patient datasets (Optum Labs data [N = 45 million], Massachusetts General Brigham [N = 6.5 million], and Quest Diagnostics [N = 263 million adults]), by sorting out subjects with documented T1D (N = 19) or T2D (N = 106) undergoing BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and then by retrospectively assessing BCG's subsequent year-by-year impact on blood sugar trends. Additionally, we performed an ecological analysis of global data to assess the country-by-country associations between mandatory neonatal BCG vaccination programs and T1D and T2D incidence. Multi-dose BCG therapy in adults with comorbid diabetes and bladder cancer was associated with multi-year and stable lowering of HbA1c in T1Ds, but not in T2Ds. The lack of a similar benefit in T2D may be due to concurrent administration of the diabetes drug metformin, which inhibits BCG's beneficial effect on glycolysis pathways. Countries with mandatory neonatal BCG vaccination policies had a lower incidence of T1D in two international databases and a lower incidence of T2D in one of the databases. The epidemiological evidence analyzed here suggests that BCG may play a role in the prevention of T1D. It does not support prevention of T2D, most likely because of interference by metformin. Our ecological analysis of global data suggests a role for neonatal BCG in the prevention of T1D and, to a lesser extent, T2D. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study.",

Comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM), which contribute to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, may also affect lymphatic endothelium. Preclinical studies suggest that metformin, a common DM treatment, may reduce lymphedema risk. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with breast cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who underwent ALND from January 2004 to December 2022 (4,882 patients overall). We stratified patients according to whether they were diagnosed with DM at the time of surgery, and if so, whether they were receiving metformin. We also conducted univariable and multivariable analyses of patient demographics for the overall cohort and the metformin vs no-metformin DM subgroups. Of the 407 patients with diabetes at the time of ALND, 250 (61%) were receiving metformin and 157 (39%) were not. Although having diabetes at the time of ALND was a significant risk factor for lymphedema on univariable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66, p < 0.001) and multivariable (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.02, p = 0.001) analysis, metformin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in lymphedema risk (univariable HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94, p = 0.023; multivariable HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89, p = 0.010). Patients with diabetic breast cancer have a significantly increased risk of developing lymphedema after ALND; however, those using metformin at the time of surgery had a lower incidence compared to non-users.",

Drug repositioning is another method used to investigate potential new agents in well-known drugs. This study assessed the survival impact of metformin medication on ovarian cancer. A national sample cohort of the Korean National Health Insurance Service Data was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyzing hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for underlying diseases and medications as confounding factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). A total of 866 eligible patients were included from among 1,025,340 cohort participants. Among them, 101 (11.7%) were metformin users. No difference in OS was observed between non-users and users. No difference in OS was observed according to age and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Long-term metformin use (≥720 days) was associated with better OS (adjusted HR=0.244; 95% CI=0.090-0.664; p=0.006). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that long-term metformin use was an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS (HR=0.193; 95% CI=0.070-0.528; p=0.001) but not for CSS (HR=0.599; 95% CI=0.178-2.017; p=0.408). Long-term metformin use reduced all-cause mortality, but not CSS in ovarian cancer. Whether metformin itself reduces deaths because of ovarian cancer requires further investigation.",

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin, widely used antidiabetic therapies, have demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects. Their comparative effectiveness in dementia prevention remains unknown. - This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated network, analyzing de-identified records from over 98 healthcare organizations. Adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or metformin as first-line therapy were propensity score-matched (1:1). The primary outcome was overall dementia incidence, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other subtypes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Time-to-event outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. - Among 74,975 matched patients in each cohort, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia: 2.7 % vs. 6.9 %: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.80 [95 % CI 0.76;0.84]. Reductions were observed in vascular dementia (0.8 % vs. 2.0 %; aHR 0.87), Alzheimer's dementia (1.1 % vs. 3.2 %; aHR, 0.76), and all-cause mortality (6.8 % vs. 15.4 %; aHR, 0.92). Benefits were pronounced in older adults, particularly those aged ≥80 years. - SGLT2is significantly reduced dementia risk and mortality compared to metformin in T2D patients. These findings suggest SGLT2is may offer superior neuroprotective benefits, underscoring their potential as a first-line therapy for T2D. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.",

This study compared 5-year mortality, composite hepatic decompensation risk, and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence in patients with diabetes and cirrhosis who were either on metformin monotherapy or on dual metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-I) therapy. This retrospective study used the TriNetX Research Network to identify propensity score-matched patients treated with either metformin or dual metformin and SGLT2-I therapy. Our outcomes were all-cause mortality, a composite of hepatic decompensation events, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence over 5 years. We estimated hazard ratios within each cohort with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Kaplan-Meier estimates for time-to-event distributions with Log-rank tests. We were able to stratify our cohorts by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. We further investigated a subset of diabetic patients with cirrhosis due to MASH. In our propensity score-matched cohorts of type 2 diabetes patients with cirrhosis, those on dual metformin and SGLT2-I therapy had decreased risk for mortality (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.81), reduced composite risk of becoming decompensated (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.43-0.93) and less than half the risk for developing HCC (HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.21-0.88) compared to those on mono metformin therapy. We did not find a difference between mono or dual therapy treatment for mortality, decompensation, or HCC risks in the subset of patients with MASH cirrhosis. Dual metformin and SGLT2-I treatment in type 2 diabetes patients with cirrhosis are associated with improved mortality and hepatic complications.",

Our study consisted of 4572 men (Black = 1352, White = 3192, Other Race = 28) diagnosed with advanced cancer (T4/M1/N1) between 1999 and 2013 in the Veteran Health Administration. The association between post-diagnostic (1) metformin and (2) statin use with all-cause and PCa-specific mortality was examined using multivariable, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard Models. In a secondary analysis, models were stratified by race. Post-diagnostic metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.84, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.73, 0.96) and PCa-specific death (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91). In stratified analyses, the inverse association between post-diagnostic metformin use and both all-cause PCa-specific mortality was limited to White men. Post-diagnostic statin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.83) and PCa-specific mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.81). In stratified analyses, similar inverse associations were observed for post-diagnostic statin use and all-cause and PCa-specific mortality in both Black and White men.

      "abstract": "Metformin may have anticancer effects that are independent of its hypoglycemic effects. Retrospective studies have shown that metformin use is associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Preclinical studies suggesting additive anticancer effects of combining metformin and bicalutamide prompted this clinical trial (NCT02614859). This open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial enrolled non-diabetic patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, a PSADT of 3-9 months, BMI > 25 and normal testosterone. Patients were randomized 1:2 to observation for an initial 8 weeks (Arm A) or metformin 1000 mg twice daily (Arm B). Bicalutamide 50 mg/day was added after 8 weeks to both arms. The primary objective was to evaluate the number of patients with undetectable PSA ( < 0.2 ng/mL) at the end of 32 weeks. Immune correlatives were assessed as exploratory endpoints. A total of 29 patients were enrolled from March 2015 to January 2020. No difference was seen between the 2 arms in the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA. Modest PSA decrease ranging from 4% to 24% were seen in 40.0% (95% CI: 19.1-64.0%) of patients with metformin monotherapy, compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 0.3-48.3%) in the observation arm. Metformin monotherapy reduced PD-1<sup>+</sup> NK cells, and increased NKG2D<sup>+</sup> NK cells. The combination of metformin and bicalutamide led to greater reductions in PD-1 expressing NK, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets compared to bicalutamide alone. The trial was stopped early due to predicted inability to achieve its primary endpoint. Although metformin plus bicalutamide was well tolerated, there was no improvement in rates of achieving undetectable PSA at 32 weeks. Metformin monotherapy induced modest PSA declines in 40% of patients after 8 weeks. Metformin, given alone and in combination with bicalutamide, displayed immune modifying effects, primarily within NK and T cells subsets. Trial Registration Number: NCT02614859.",

We assessed if metformin is associated with reduced incidence of severe COVID-19 for patients with prediabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), common diseases that increase the risk of severe COVID-19. This observational, retrospective study utilized EHR data from 52 hospitals for COVID-19 patients with PCOS or prediabetes treated with metformin or levothyroxine/ondansetron (controls). After balancing via inverse probability score weighting, associations with COVID-19 severity were assessed by logistic regression. In the prediabetes cohort, when compared to levothyroxine, metformin was associated with a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19 with \"mild-ED\" or worse (OR [95% CI]: 0.636, [0.455-0.888]) and \"moderate\" or worse severity (0.493 [0.339-0.718]). Compared to ondansetron, metformin was associated with lower incidence of \"mild-ED\" or worse severity (0.039 [0.026-0.057]), \"moderate\" or worse (0.045 [0.03-0.069]), \"severe\" or worse (0.183 [0.077-0.431]), and \"mortality/hospice\" (0.223 [0.071-0.694]). For PCOS, metformin showed no significant differences in severity compared to levothyroxine, but was associated with a significantly lower incidence of \"mild-ED\" or worse (0.101 [0.061-0.166]), and \"moderate\" or worse (0.094 [0.049-0.18]) COVID-19 outcome compared to ondansetron. Metformin use is associated with less severe COVID-19 in patients with prediabetes or PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Although studies in several cancer types suggest that metformin has antitumor activity, its effect on the outcome of targeted therapies in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is poorly defined. We aimed to analyze the effect of metformin use on the outcome of sunitinib treatment in diabetic patients with mRCC. We performed a retrospective study of diabetic patients with mRCC, who were treated with sunitinib in 8 centers across 2 countries. Patients were divided into metformin users and nonusers. The effect of metformin use on response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), was tested. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses of the association between clinicopathologic factors and metformin use, and outcome were performed using the entire patient cohort. Between 2004 and 2014, 108 diabetic patients with mRCC were treated with sunitinib. There were 52 metformin users (group 1) and 56 nonusers (group 2). The groups were balanced regarding clinicopathologic factors. Clinical benefit (partial response + stable disease) in group 1 versus 2 was 96% versus 84% (P = .054). Median PFS was 15 versus 11.5 months (P = .1). Median OS was 32 versus 21 months (P = .001). In multivariate analyses of the entire patient cohort (n = 108), factors associated with PFS were active smoking and pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 3. Factors associated with OS were metformin use (hazard ratio, 0.21; P < .0001), Heng risk, active smoking, liver metastases, and pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 3. Metformin might improve the OS of diabetic patients with mRCC who are treated with sunitinib.",

      "abstract": "Studies have suggested a positive association between bladder cancer (BC) outcome and comedication use, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), metformin, and prednisone use. To validate these associations, we evaluated whether these medications were associated with clinical outcome in a Canadian cohort of BC patients. This is a retrospective cohort study on BC patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) in Québec province in 2000-2015, as registered in the provincial health administration databases. Medication use was considered chronic when prescribed for ≥ 1 year. Overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and recurrence-free (RFS) survival were compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Covariates included age, Charlson's comorbidity index, region of residence, year of RC, distance to hospital, hospital type, hospital and surgeon annual RC volume, neoadjuvant chemotherapy use, and type of bladder diversion, as well as mutual adjustment for concomitant comedication use (statins, NSAIDs, metformin, and prednisone). Of 3742 patients included, 293, 420, and 1503 patients chronically used prednisone, metformin, and NSAIDs before surgery, respectively. In multivariable analyses, preoperative prednisone use was associated with improved OS (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.55-0.82), DSS (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.45-0.76), and RFS (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.47-0.78). Patients who chronically used metformin preoperatively had a worse OS (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.55), DSS (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.10-1.72), and RFS (HR 1.41, 95%CI 1.13-1.74). Preoperative, chronic NSAID use was not significantly associated with all clinical outcomes, with adjusted HRs for OS, DSS, and RFS of 1.10 (95%CI 0.95-1.27), 1.24 (95%CI 1.03-1.48), and 1.22 (95%CI 1.03-1.45), respectively. Directionality of findings was similar when stratifying by comedication use in the year following surgery. Results were similar after propensity-score matching too. In our Canadian cohort of BC undergoing RC, chronic prednisone use was associated with improved clinical outcomes, while metformin and NSAID were not.",

However, the relationship between ODX recurrence score (RS) and diabetes, a common comorbidity in breast cancer patients, has been inadequately described in the literature. Specifically, the association of diabetes treatment with metformin and RS is inconclusive, with different studies reporting conflicting results. Because diabetes has been associated with higher RS, it has been suggested that management of diabetes with metformin in breast cancer patients may be associated with a lower RS. We studied a large cohort of early-stage, hormone-positive breast cancer patients to determine if there is an association between RS and metformin treatment. In this study, we retrospectively examined the medical records of 514 early-stage, hormone-positive breast cancer patients who had oncotype testing performed between 2007 and 2017. Number (%) or median were used to describe the patients' characteristics between groups and were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test at a significance level of 5%. Of this cohort, 67 (13%) had a diabetes diagnosis at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, including both diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes. The median RS for non-diabetic patients was 16 and the median RS for diabetic patients was 15. This difference was not significant, nor was there a statistical difference in RS between diabetic patients taking metformin (median RS = 15) and diabetic patients not taking metformin (median RS = 15). These results held true even when controlling for BMI. We conclude that neither diabetes diagnosis nor metformin use is associated with a difference in oncotype RS in this population of diabetic patients.",

Clinical trials have shown a higher risk for different types of tumours in diabetic patients. This risk is potentiated by immunosuppressive therapy in transplant patients. Biguanide metformin has been shown to exhibit anti-tumour activity and we tried to find out whether this effect is valid for heart transplant patients. We retrospectively analysed a group of 497 patients, who undergone HTx in our centre between 1998 and 2019. The primary outcome was any malignancy during the 15-year follow-up period and patient's survival. Out of the 497 patients enrolled in the study, 279 (56 %) had diabetes and 52 (19 %) were treated with metformin. Fifteen-year survival in treated patients without malignancy was 93 %, the remainder for the DM patients was 56 %, with survival in non-DM patients being 74 %. Untreated diabetic patients had 4.7 times higher chance of malignancy than those on metformin (p = 0.01). Fifteen-year survival in metformin treated patients was 53 %, in other DM patients 44 %, and in non-DM patients 51 %. Our study showed a significantly lower incidence of malignancies in metformin-treated patients and slightly better overall survival (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 19) Keywords: biguanide, heart graft, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, survival.",

      "abstract": "This study was set out to determine whether metformin use influences survival in breast cancer patients treated with antidiabetic drugs as compared to non-users. We used data from the Danish national registries (1996-2008) to identify adult female patients diagnosed with breast cancer who were prescribed antidiabetic medication. We performed multivariate Coxproportional hazard regression to assess all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality risks associated with metformin exposure. In a secondary analysis, we stratified use of metformin according to the cumulative number of prescriptions. Of the 1058 breast cancer patients 349 died during follow-up, with breast cancer listed as the primary cause of death for 152 cases. Compared to non-use, current metformin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.58-0.96). For breast cancer-specific mortality, a non-significant risk reduction (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.59-1.29) was observed, which became significant after stratification according to cumulative number of prescriptions. An increased risk of both overall and breast cancer-specific mortality was observed in the first 12 months after discontinuation of metformin. We observed a nonsignificant reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality associated with metformin exposure among breast cancer patients treated with antidiabetic drugs. However, our findings suggest that long-term metformin use may have a beneficial effect on survival in patients with breast cancer. Further confirmation of these findings is needed.",

Type 2 diabetes patients newly diagnosed during 1999-2005 and with 2 or more prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs were enrolled from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. A total of 173 917 ever-users and 21 900 never-users of metformin were identified (unmatched cohort). A 1:1 matched-pair cohort of 21 900 ever-users and 21 900 never-users based on a propensity score (PS) was created. Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using the PS. In addition, interactions with aspirin and statin were evaluated. In the unmatched cohort, 619 never-users and 2642 ever-users developed HCC, with a respective incidence of 668.0 and 330.7 per 100 000 person-years and an overall hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.54). The hazard ratios for the first (<25.7 months), second (25.7-56.9 months) and third (>56.9 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 0.89 (0.81-0.98), 0.50 (0.46-0.56) and 0.23 (0.21-0.26) respectively. Analyses of the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of 0.76 (0.67-0.85), and the hazard ratios for the respective tertiles were 1.39 (1.19-1.62), 0.77 (0.65-0.91) and 0.37 (0.30-0.45).

Overall, 1106 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (94.3 % with stage IV disease) were included. The outcomes were compared between the patients with (n = 186) and without diabetes (n = 920). The characteristics associated with antidiabetic treatment and proper glycemic control (defined as a mean plasma glucose <130 mg/dL) were examined at diagnosis. The overall survivals (OSs) of the different patient populations were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the influences of the patient and tumor characteristics on survival. The OS for the entire population was 18.3 months (95 % CI 16.1-20.4). There was no difference in the OSs of the diabetic and non-diabetic patients (18.5 vs 16.4 months, p = 0.62). The diabetic patients taking metformin exhibited a superior OS than did those on other antidiabetic treatments (25.6 vs 13.2 months, p = 0.017). Those with proper glycemic control had a better OS than did those without proper glycemic control and the non-diabetics (40.5 vs 13.2 and 18.5 months, respectively, p < 0.001). Both the use of metformin (HR 0.53, p < 0.0001 and HR 0.57, p = 0.017, respectively) and proper glycemic control (HR 0.49, p < 0.0001 and HR 0.40, p = 0.002, respectively) were significant protective factors in all and only diabetic patients, respectively. The diabetic patients with proper glycemic control exhibited a better OS than did those without proper glycemic control and even exhibited a better OS than did the patients without diabetes mellitus. Metformin use was independently associated with a better OS.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies provide conflicting evidence on whether metformin is protective against cancer. When studying time-varying exposure to metformin, covariates such as body mass index (BMI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may act as both confounders and causal pathway variables, and so cannot be handled adequately by standard regression methods. Marginal structural models (MSMs) with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) can correctly adjust for such confounders. Using this approach, the main objective of this study was to estimate the effect of metformin on cancer risk compared with risk in patients with T2DM taking no medication. Patients with incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database of electronic health records derived from primary care in the UK. Patients entered the study at diabetes diagnosis or the first point after this when they had valid HbA1c and BMI measurements, and follow-up was split into 1-month intervals. Logistic regression was used to calculate IPTW; then the effect of metformin on all cancers (including and excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers was estimated in the weighted population. A total of 55 629 T2DM patients were alive and cancer-free at their study entry; 2530 people had incident cancer during a median follow-up time of 2.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.3-5.4 years]. Using the MSM approach, the hazard ratio (HR) for all cancers, comparing treatment with metformin with no glucose-lowering treatment, was 1.02 (0.88-1.18). Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and remained consistent when estimating the treatment effect by length of exposure. We also found no evidence of a protective effect of metformin on individual cancer outcomes. We find no evidence that metformin has a causal association with cancer risk.",

Type II diabetes has been linked to the development of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), consisting of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

In this study, we aim to investigate the association between sulfonylureas use and the development of KC in patients with KC history. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial, which was a randomized double-blind vehicle-control cream originally investigating the effect of 5-fluorouracil on KC development. 932 patients with a history of KC were enrolled (98% male, 99% white, median age of 70 years) and followed for a median duration of 2.8 years. 153 patients were on metformin and 94 on sulfonylureas. We performed a survival analysis with cox regression and controlled for body mass index and known predictors: number of prior BCCs and age (for BCC) and for number of prior SCCs (invasive and in situ), number of actinic keratoses at baseline (for SCC).

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of metformin exposure on mortality, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with diabetes and cirrhosis, controlling for multiple concomitant exposures. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed between January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2016, in the Veterans Health administration. Marginal structural models and propensity-matching approaches were implemented to quantify the treatment effect of metformin in patients with pre-existing diabetes with or without prior metformin exposure. Among 74,984 patients with cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus was present before the diagnosis of cirrhosis in 53.8%, and was diagnosed during follow-up evaluation in 4.8%. Before the diagnosis of cirrhosis, 11,114 patients had active utilization of metformin. In these patients, metformin, statin, and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-2-receptor blocker exposure were associated independently with reduced mortality (metformin hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75); metformin was not associated with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation after adjustment for concomitant statin exposure. For patients with diabetes before a diagnosis of cirrhosis but no prior metformin exposure, metformin similarly was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.35-0.97), but not with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation. Metformin use in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes appears safe and is associated independently with reduced overall, but not liver-related, mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, or decompensation after adjusting for concomitant statin and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-2-receptor blocker exposure.",

We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD and DM diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008. We followed patients from the date of NAFLD diagnosis to HCC, death, or 12/31/2018. We used landmark Cox proportional hazards models to determine the effects of anti-DM medications (metformin, insulin, sulfonylureas) and glycemic control (percent of follow-up time with hemoglobin A1c < 7%) on the risk of HCC while adjusting for demographics and other metabolic traits (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia). We identified 85,963 patients with NAFLD and DM. In total, 524 patients developed HCC during a mean of 10.3 years of follow-up. Most common treatments were metformin monotherapy (19.7%), metformin-sulfonylureas (19.6%), insulin (9.3%), and sulfonylureas monotherapy (13.6%). Compared with no medication, metformin was associated with 20% lower risk of HCC (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98). Insulin had no effect on HCC risk (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85-1.22; p = 0.85). Insulin in combination with other oral medications was associated with a 1.6 to 1.7-fold higher risk of HCC. Adequate glycemic control was associated with a 31% lower risk of HCC (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.78). In this large cohort of patients with NAFLD and DM, use of metformin was associated with a reduced risk of HCC, whereas use of combination therapy was associated with increased risk. Glycemic control can serve as a biomarker for HCC risk stratification in patients with NAFLD and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Metformin has anticarcinogenic properties and is also known to inhibit the sonic hedgehog pathway, but population-based studies analyzing the potential protective effect for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are needed. To delineate the association between metformin use and invasive SCC, SCC in situ (SCCis), and BCC. A population-based case-control study design was employed using all 6880 patients diagnosed in Iceland between 2003-2017 with first-time BCC, SCCis, or invasive SCC, and 69,620 population controls. Multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Metformin was associated with a lower risk of developing BCC (OR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.83), even at low doses. No increased risk of developing SCC was observed. SCCis risk was mildly elevated in the 501-1500 daily dose unit category (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.96). This study was retrospective in nature with the inability to adjust for ultraviolet exposure, Fitzpatrick skin type, and comorbidities. Metformin is associated with decreased risk of BCC development, even at low doses. Metformin might have potential as a chemoprotective agent for patients at high risk of BCC, although this will need confirmation in future studies.",

      "abstract": "No evidence exists as to whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impairs clinical outcome from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with solid tumors. In a large cohort of ICI recipients treated at 21 institutions from June 2014 to June 2020, we studied whether patients on glucose-lowering medications (GLM) for T2DM had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We used targeted transcriptomics in a subset of patients to explore differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients with or without diabetes. A total of 1,395 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 54.7%), melanoma (24.7%), renal cell (15.0%), and other carcinomas (5.6%). After multivariable analysis, patients on GLM (n = 226, 16.2%) displayed an increased risk of death [HR, 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.07-1.56] and disease progression/death (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43) independent of number of GLM received. We matched 92 metformin-exposed patients with 363 controls and 78 patients on other oral GLM or insulin with 299 control patients. Exposure to metformin, but not other GLM, was associated with an increased risk of death (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16-2.03) and disease progression/death (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Patients with T2DM with higher pretreatment glycemia had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.04), while exploratory tumoral transcriptomic profiling in a subset of patients (n = 22) revealed differential regulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways in patients with T2DM. In this study, patients on GLM experienced worse outcomes from immunotherapy, independent of baseline features. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the relative impact of metformin over a preexisting diagnosis of T2DM in influencing poorer outcomes in this population.",

The current study was designed to elucidate the effect of metformin on tumor growth in sporadic VS using volumetric analyses. Retrospective cohort. Tertiary referral center. Patients with sporadic VS who elected initial conservative treatment with at least two serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were included. Metformin use among patients with observed sporadic VS. Tumor growth, defined as an increase in volume of at least 20% from the initial MRI. A total of 361 patients were evaluated. Thirty-four patients (9%) had a diagnosis of diabetes at baseline. Nineteen patients (5%) were taking metformin at the time of the initial MRI. Metformin use was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of volumetric tumor growth in a univariable analysis in all patients undergoing observation for VS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.40-1.42; p = 0.38) or within the diabetic subset (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.34-1.83; p = 0.58). Additionally, diabetes status, insulin dependence, hemoglobin A1c value, and metformin dose were not significantly associated with volumetric tumor growth. Despite promising initial results in several previous studies, our data suggest that metformin use does not significantly reduce the risk of volumetric tumor growth in sporadic VS.",

In this study, we assessed the association between metformin use and overall survival in glioblastoma patients. We retrospectively studied 241 patients who underwent surgery at diagnosis of glioblastoma between 2014 and 2018. Metformin was used for pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus or in the prevention or management of glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank p test were used for univariate analysis. Cox-proportional hazards model was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios for multivariate analysis. Metformin use was associated with longer survival in patients with tumors that had a methylated O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) promoter (484 days 95% CI: 56-911 vs. 394 days 95% CI: 249-538, Log-Rank test: 6.5, p = 0.01). Cox regression analysis shows that metformin associates with lower risk of death at 2 years in patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated MGMT promoter (aHR = 0.497, 95% CI 0.26-0.93, p = 0.028). Our findings suggest a survival benefit with metformin use in patients with glioblastomas having methylation of the MGMT promoter.",

      "abstract": "This retrospective cohort study investigated whether metformin may reduce gastric cancer risk by using the reimbursement databases of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance. Patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed during 1999-2005 and newly treated with metformin (n=287971, \"ever users of metformin\") or other antidiabetic drugs (n=16217, \"never users of metformin\") were followed until December 31, 2011. The effect of metformin (for ever versus never users, and for tertiles of cumulative duration of therapy) was estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score. Results showed that the respective numbers of incident gastric cancer in ever and never users were 759 (0.26%) and 89 (0.55%), with respective incidences of 55.26 and 122.53 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 0.448 (0.359-0.558) suggested a significantly lower risk among ever users. In tertile analyses, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the first (＜21.47 months), second (21.47-45.97 months) and third (＞45.97 months) tertile of cumulative duration was 0.973 (0.773-1.224), 0.422 (0.331-0.537) and 0.120 (0.090-0.161), respectively, while compared to never users. In conclusion, metformin significantly reduces gastric cancer risk, especially when the cumulative duration is more than approximately 2 years.",

Data are not available in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. The aim of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the potential impact in terms of clinical outcome of the common non-cancer medications. All consecutive patients with CCAs were retrospectively identified from 7 Italian medical institutions. We investigated the role of intake of vitamin D, aspirin, metformin, statins, and diuretics. A total of 537 patients with CCAs were identified; 197 patients undergoing surgery were evaluated for disease-free survival (DFS), and 509 patients with an advanced stage were evaluated for overall survival (OS). A longer DFS was found in patients with intake of vitamin D versus never users (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02). In an advanced stage an association with OS was found in patients with intake of metformin versus never users (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.93, p = 0.0162), and in patients who have started taking metformin after chemotherapy versus before chemotherapy and never users (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.73, p = 0.0016). Our results highlighted that vitamin D intake improves DFS in patients undergoing surgery. Metformin intake after starting chemotherapy can improve the clinical outcome in advanced disease. These results could open up new therapeutic strategies in cholangiocarcinoma patients. We are planning to undertake a prospective study to validate these data.",

Its primarily regulates hepatic and colonic glucose metabolism, but recent studies have suggested an anti-inflammatory effect, especially in colitis. It has been suggested that metformin may enhance immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) efficacy for cancer treatment. Our study aims to explore the impact of metformin on ICI efficacy and the risk for colitis. This was a single center, retrospective analysis of consecutive patients at a tertiary cancer center who received ICI between 01/2010-12/2022 and developed immune-mediated colitis (IMC). Patients were screened for colitis based on stool tests, then divided into two groups depending on metformin use prior to colitis onset. We collected data on demographic and colitis clinical information including treatments, and outcomes. A total of 953 patients were included. The incidence of IMC was higher among metformin users (7.6 %) than non-metformin users (4.9 %; p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in colitis features and outcomes, except for longer hospital stay among metformin users (8 days vs 6 for non-metformin users; p = 0.03). Metformin use was associated with shorter overall survival vs non-metformin users among patients with IMC (p = 0.03). Our study is among the first to explore the impact of metformin on IMC and overall survival. We found that metformin use may be associated with higher risk of IMC. We also found an association between metformin use and shorter overall survival among patients who developed IMC. Larger studies with risk-stratified analysis are needed to validate our findings.",

Also, metformin may exert a protective role against thyroid nodules growth in patients without insulin-resistance. The cross-talk between tyrosine kinase receptors and the G protein-coupled receptors (which the TSHR belongs to) has been already shown and IRS1 may represent the hub link between TSHR and IR pathways. By influencing IRS1 phosphorylation pattern, metformin may sensitize TSHR to TSH, thus explaining the findings of clinical studies. However, the existence of this molecular pathway must be confirmed through proper studies and further prospective randomized placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Conflicting data exists on the influence of metformin on prostate cancer. We investigated the importance of metformin in patients treated with radiotherapy or brachytherapy. All patients from a large institutionalized database, treated for primary localized prostate cancer with either brachytherapy or external-beam radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy were identified. Groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models. Multivariate analysis was adjusted for CAPRA-Score, type of treatment and age. A total of 2441 patients with complete data was identified. Among the 382 patients (16% of total) were diabetic. Two-hundred and eighty-one of the 382 diabetics (74%) were treated with metformin and 101 were treated with other anti-diabetic medication. Median follow up was 48 months (interquartile range [IQR] 24-84). Two-hundred eighteen patients (9%) died and 150 (6%) experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR). On unadjusted univariate analysis for BCR-free survival, metformin users showed a 50% reduction in BCR compared to non-metformin users. The results remained significant on multivariate analysis comparing diabetic metformin users to non-metformin users (diabetics and non-diabetics combined) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5-0.6, p = 0.03-0.04) but lost its significance when adjusting for cancer aggressiveness. On multivariate analysis, diabetics had worse overall survival (OS) than non-diabetics (HR 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.06, p = 0.01), but diabetics on metformin fared better than diabetics not taking metformin (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26-0.86, p = 0.01). Metformin use in this analysis appears to be associated with better BCR and OS. Larger datasets and prospective trials are warranted to validate these results.",

While there are multiple therapeutic options for both types, patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer still suffer from poor prognosis. The study aimed to examine the association between the risk of oesophageal cancer and medications and to estimate the chemopreventive effects of commonly used drugs. A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 9 hospital databases of hospitalized patients between 2014 and 2019. The primary outcomes were ESCC and EAC. The association of oesophageal cancer with drug use and clinical factors was evaluated.

The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.48, p < 0.0001), aspirin (aOR 0.32, p < 0.0001), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (COX2I) (aOR 0.70, p = 0.0005), steroid (aOR 0.19, p < 0.0001), statin (aOR 0.43, p < 0.0001), and metformin (aOR 0.42, p < 0.0001) was associated with a lower risk of ESCC than that in non-use. The use of aspirin (aOR 0.33, p = 0.0006) and steroids (aOR 0.54, p = 0.022) was associated with a lower risk of EAC than that in non-use. COX2Is, statins, metformin, and PPIs could help in prevention of ESCC, and aspirin and steroids may be chemopreventive for both types of oesophageal cancer.",

This study was retrospectively designed based on data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort (HEALS) between 2002 and 2015. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test was performed to estimate the survival function according to metformin usage (3721 metformin non-users with diabetes, 5580 metformin users with diabetes, and 24,483 non-diabetic individuals). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.The median follow-up duration was 4.2 years. The HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality of metformin users and the non-diabetic group were 0.762 (0.683-0.850) and 1.055 (0.966-1.152) in men and 0.805 (0.649-0.999), and 1.049 (0.873-1.260) in women, respectively, compared with metformin non-users among diabetic cancer survivors, in a fully adjusted model. After stratifying metformin users into pre- and post-diagnosis of cancers, adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of pre- and post-diagnosis metformin users for all-cause mortality were 0.948 (0.839-1.071) and 0.530 (0.452-0.621) in men and 1.163 (0.921-1.469) and 0.439 (0.323-0.596) in women, respectively.Metformin use in cancer survivors with diabetes reduced overall mortality rates. In particular, metformin use after cancer diagnosis, not before cancer diagnosis, was inversely associated with overall mortality.Active treatment with metformin for diabetic cancer survivors after cancer diagnosis can improve their survival rates.",

We assembled a retrospective cohort data of 20 577 patients who were free of cancer and on metformin-sulfonylurea dual therapy, and whose drug treatments were intensified with DPP4i (n=9957), insulin (n=7760), or thiazolidinediones (n=2860) from January 2006 to December 2017. Propensity-score weighting was used to balance out baseline covariates across the three groups. HRs for any types of cancer, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Over a mean follow-up period of 34 months with 58 539 person-years, cumulative incidences of cancer, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were 0.028, 0.009, and 0.072, respectively. Patients intensified with insulin had the highest incidence of all-cause mortality (incidence rate=3.22/100 person-years) and the insulin itself posed the greatest risk (HR 2.46, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.70, p<0.001; 2.44, 95% CI 2.23 to 2.67) compared with thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, respectively. Comparing between thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, thiazolidinediones was associated with higher risk of cancer (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.63) but not cancer mortality (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.58) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11). Insulin was associated with the greatest risk of cancer mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.71; 1.65, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.07) compared with thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, respectively. For patients with T2DM on metformin-sulfonylurea dual therapy, the addition of DPP4i was the third-line medication least likely to be associated with cancer mortality and cancer effect among three options, and posed no increased risk for all-cause mortality when compared with thiazolidinediones.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) and the consecutively daily use of antidiabetic medication are characterized by a frequent prevalence worldwide and were shown to impact the initiation and progression of malignant diseases. While these effects were observed in a variety of malignancies, comprehensive data about the role of DM2 and antidiabetic drugs in the outcome of head and neck melanoma (HNM) patients are missing. This retrospective population-based cohort study included 382 HNM patients from Eastern Bavaria having received tumor resection to negative margins between 2010 and 2017. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was evaluated with regard to DM2 and routine metformin intake. Statistical analysis was performed by uni- and multivariate analyses. The median follow-up time was 5.6 years. DM2 was diagnosed in 68 patients (17.8%), routine metformin intake was found in 39 cases (10.2%). The univariate survival analysis revealed impaired 5-year RFS in HNM patients with DM2 compared to non-diabetic controls (<i>p</i> = 0.016; 64.0% and 74.5%, respectively). The multivariate Cox regression substantiated this effect (HR = 1.980, 95% CI = 1.108-3.538, <i>p</i> = 0.021). In detail, the cumulative locoregional recurrence rate displayed the most far-reaching negative effect on the RFS of diabetic HNM patients (HR = 4.173, 95% CI = 1.628-10.697, <i>p</i> = 0.003). For metformin intake, a profound positive effect on the RFS in multivariate statistics was observed, both in the complete cohort (HR = 0.396, 95% CI = 0.177-0.884, <i>p</i> = 0.024) as well as in the cohort of diabetic HNM patients (HR = 0.352, 95% CI = 0.135-0.913, <i>p</i> = 0.032). This study emphasizes that DM2 is a relevant comorbid condition in HNM patients, impairing patient survival. Metformin intake was associated with a favorable outcome in HNM patients, providing possible therapeutic implications for future adjuvant treatment regimes.",

      "abstract": "Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may modulate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in diabetics. We have analyzed the role of various antidiabetic drugs on HCC in a nested case-control study using the healthcare utilization databases of the Lombardy Region in Italy. This included 190 diabetic subjects with a hospital discharge reporting a diagnosis of malignant HCC and 3772 diabetic control subjects matched to each case on sex, age, date at cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Increased risks of HCC were found for use of insulin (odds ratio [OR] = 3.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-5.51), sulfonylureas (OR = 1.39, 95%CI 0.98-1.99), and repaglinide (OR = 2.12, 95%CI 1.38-3.26), while a reduced risk was found for use of metformin (OR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.79). The risk of HCC increased with increasing duration of insulin use (OR = 2.52 for <1 year, 5.41 for 1-2 years, and 6.01 for ≥2 years; p for trend < 0.001), while no clear pattern with duration was observed for sulfonylureas, repaglinide, and metformin. Our study supports the evidence that patients with diabetes using metformin, and possibly other antidiabetic drugs that increase insulin sensibility, have a reduced risk of HCC, while those using insulin or drugs that increase circulating insulin, such as insulin secretagogues, have an increased risk. Whether these associations are causal, or influenced by different severity of diabetes and/or possible residual bias or misclassification, is still open to discussion.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical studies have shown anticancer activities of metformin in gastric cancer and a recent epidemiological study showed a decrease in recurrence and mortality of gastric cancer in metformin users. This study aimed to assess the impact of metformin on gastric cancer survival in diabetic patients at a Belgian population level. We conducted an observational, population-based study by linking data of the Belgian Cancer Registry with medical claims data coming from the health insurance companies for patients diagnosed with stage I to III gastric adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2012. Information on gastric cancer-specific deaths was retrieved from mortality records collected by regional governments. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific mortality (CSS). In our population of 371 patients, a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in metformin users (adjusted HR = 0.73, 95% CI: [0.52; 1.01], p = 0.06) but not for cancer specific mortality (adjusted HR = 0.86, 95% CI: [0.56; 1.33], p = 0.50). Pre-diagnosis exposure to metformin was associated with a significant improvement in OS (adjusted HR = 0.75, 95% CI: [0.57; 0.98], p = 0.04) that was not significant for CSS (adjusted HR = 0.89, 95% CI: [0.62; 1.28], p = 0.52). Moreover, no dose-response relationship between metformin use and either all-cause or cancer-specific mortality was observed. In the first population based study of metformin use in gastric cancer adenocarcinoma patients with previous diabetes, our findings suggest that metformin use might improve overall mortality. However, no such association was found for cancer-specific survival. Additional studies in other populations are required.",

In this study, we sought to determine the association between metformin administration and TACE outcomes for single nodular HCC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The retrospective cohort analysis included 164 T2DM patients with single nodular HCC who underwent TACE as an initial treatment, and 91 were exposed to metformin before and after TACE. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to balance covariates. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of tumor response after TACE, and Cox regression analysis assessed independent predictors of local tumor recurrence (LTR) in patients with complete response after TACE. Metformin use was associated with significantly higher objective response rate (ORR) in the overall and PS-matched cohort (79.1% vs. 60.3 and 78.7% vs. 57.5%; p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that metformin use was an independent predictor of ORR in all and PS-matched patients (odds ratio = 2.65 and 3.06; p = 0.016 and 0.034, respectively). Cox regression analysis showed metformin administration was an independent predictor for lower LTR in all and PS-matched patients (hazard ratio = 0.28 and 0.27; p = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Metformin administration is associated with better initial response and lower local recurrence after TACE for single nodular HCC in T2DM.",

Metformin, one of the most commonly used anti-diabetic drugs worldwide, has also been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity. We therefore investigated the association between metformin therapy and malignancy after HTx. The study population comprised 237 patients who underwent HTx between 1991 and 2016 and were prospectively followed-up. Clinical data were recorded on prospectively designed forms. The primary outcome was any cancer recorded during 15 years of follow-up. Treatment with metformin and the development of DM after HTx were assessed as time-dependent factors in the analyses. Of the 237 study patients, 85 (36%) had diabetes. Of the DM patients, 48 (56%) were treated with metformin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that, at 15 years after HTx, malignancy rate was 4% for DM patients treated with metformin, 62% for those who did not receive metformin and 27% for non-DM patients (log-rank test, p < 0.0001). Consistently, multivariate analysis showed that for DM patients, metformin therapy was independently associated with a significant 90% reduction (hazard ratio = 0.10; 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.40; p = 0.001) in the risk of the development of a malignancy. DM patients who were treated with metformin had a markedly lower risk (65%; p = 0.001) for the development of a malignancy or death after HTx as compared with non-DM patients. Our findings suggest that metformin therapy is independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of malignancy after HTx.",

This study examined whether metformin was associated with reduced CRC risk, both overall and stratified by anatomic site, in a large sample of persons with diabetes who underwent colonoscopy. We performed a case-control study of US Veterans with prevalent diabetes who underwent colonoscopy between 1999 and 2014 using Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health record data. Cases were defined by presence of CRC at colonoscopy, while controls had normal colonoscopy. The primary exposure was metformin use at time of colonoscopy (yes/no). Association of metformin exposure with CRC (further stratified by proximal, distal, or rectal subsite) was examined using multivariable and multinomial logistic regression and summarized by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 6,650 CRC patients and 454,507 normal colonoscopy patients. CRC cases were older and had lower metformin exposure. Metformin was associated with 8% relative reduction in CRC odds (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.96). By subsite, metformin was associated with a 14% statistically significant reduced rectal cancer odds (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.94) but no reduced distal or proximal cancer odds. Metformin was associated with reduced CRC odds-particularly rectal cancer-in a large sample of persons with diabetes undergoing colonoscopy.",

We aimed to investigate the association between different glucose-lowering treatments, including DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin, both with potential NRF2 modulating effects, and new-onset metastatic cancer among type 2 diabetes patients with comorbid incident cancer. This population-based cohort study included 223,530 diabetic patients newly diagnosed with primary cancer during 2009-2011 in Korea. The patients were categorized into five study cohorts in accordance with treatment modalities during the follow-up until the end of 2016: no-antidiabetic drugs (no-AD), metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin treatment. After propensity score (PS) matching in a 1:1 ratio against the no-AD group, 18,805 patients in metformin, 1,865 in DPP-4 inhibitors, 31,074 in metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and 1,895 patients in insulin groups were identified for cohort entry and analyzed against the corresponding number of no-AD patients in each PS-matched comparison pair. Metastatic risk was lower with metformin plus or minus DPP-4 inhibitors (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90 and 0.87, 0.80-0.95, respectively), not significantly associated with DPP-4 inhibitors (0.99, 0.77-1.29) except after thyroid cancer (3.89, 1.01-9.64), and higher with insulin therapy (1.81, 1.46-2.24) compared to no-AD use for all cancers combined. In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitor therapy was not associated with significant risk of cancer metastasis relative to no-AD therapy, irrespective of patient age and sex, except after thyroid cancer, while metastatic risk was decreased with metformin treatment among type 2 diabetes patients with preexisting cancer.",

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an intractable digestive organ cancer and new treatment strategy is required. In this study, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis of ESCC cell lines treated with metformin, which provided helpful information on the antitumor effects of metformin in ESCC. Next, we selected a promising gene among them and examined its effects on ESCC properties. We examined metformin-induced mRNA expression changes in two human ESCC cell lines by performing next-generation sequencing (NGS) and pathway analysis. Heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 6 (HSPA6) expression in surgical specimens obtained from 83 ESCC patients who underwent curative operations was evaluated immunohistochemically and analyzed. Metformin upregulated mRNA expression of the many genes, including HSPA6, a cancer immune-related gene, and inhibited mRNA expression of the other many genes. Pathway analysis indicated major canonical pathways and upstream regulators related to metformin. The result indicated HSPA6 as a promising biomarker. HSPA6 expression correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients with all stage ESCC (p = 0.021), especially with stage I/II ESCC (p < 0.001). With stage III, low HSPA6 expression was not associated with poor DFS (p = 0.918). Multivariate analysis indicated that independent low HSPA6 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor of stage I/II ESCC (p < 0.001). However, HSPA6 expression did not correlate with the clinicopathological characteristics, including age, sex, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and tumor markers of the patients with stage I/II ESCC. This NGS analysis detected prospective candidate genes, including HSPA6. Our results indicate that HSPA6 is a promising biomarker of the recurrence risk of stage I/II ESCC. Further studies on HSPA6 would lead to better treatment.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the potential synergistic effects of combined exenatide (EXE) and dapagliflozin (DAPA) versus (PLAC) placebo and DAPA on hepatocellular lipid (HCL) reduction after 24 weeks of treatment. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to weekly EXE and daily DAPA (n = 16) or weekly PLAC and daily DAPA (n = 14). Inclusion criteria were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 48 to 97 mmol/mol (6.5-11%), age 18 to 75 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and metformin ≥1000 mg. The primary endpoint, HCL levels, were measured at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Between-group effects were analysed using general linear models, adjusted for baseline outcome variables, age, sex and BMI. Within-group differences were assessed using a paired t-test. After 24 weeks, HCLs were reduced in both treatment groups (absolute change from baseline: EXE + DAPA -4.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.2, -0.7, P < 0.05; PLAC + DAPA -3.9%, 95% CI -6.0, -1.7, P < 0.01; relative change: EXE + DAPA -35.6%, PLAC + DAPA -32.3%) with no difference between groups. Similar findings were observed for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). HbA1c (EXE + DAPA -17.8 mmol/mol, [95% CI -24.8, -10.8], P <0.001; PLAC + DAPA -6.9 mmol/mol, [95% CI -10.5, -3.3], P = 0.001) and fasting glucose significantly decreased in both groups, although EXE + DAPA achieved better glycaemic control than PLAC + DAPA (adjusted difference: HbA1c -6.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -9.7, -2.2], P < 0.01). Body weight was reduced in both treatment groups (EXE + DAPA -7.3 kg, 95% CI -9.9, -4.8, P <0.001; PLAC + DAPA -4.6 kg, 95% CI -7.4, -1.8, P <0.01) with comparable results between groups. Changes in HCLs and weight, hip and waist circumference, VAT and SAT were positively associated. After 24 weeks, HCLs were significantly but comparably reduced in the EXE + DAPA and PLAC + DAPA groups, despite significantly better glycaemic control in the combined group EXE + DAPA. Changes in HCLs were associated with weight loss and reduction of visceral adiposity, but not with glucose control. Further studies are necessary to evaluate possible additional long-term effects of a combined treatment.",

We performed a retrospective review of 3217 patients, from 1998 to 2013, subdivided into 5 subgroups: (I) no T2DM; (II) T2DM receiving oral antihyperglycemic agent that contains metformin, no insulin; (III) T2DM receiving nonmetformin oral agent alone, no insulin; (IV) T2DM receiving any insulin; and (V) T2DM not receiving medication. Outcome measures were overall survival, freedom from biochemical failure (BF), freedom from distant metastasis, cancer-specific survival, and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank tests, Fine and Gray competing risk regression (to adjust for patient and lifestyle factors), Cox models, and subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) were used. Of the 3217 patients, 1295 (40%) were low-risk, 1192 (37%) were intermediate-risk, and 652 (20%) were high risk. The group I to V distribution was 81%, 8%, 5%, 3%, and 4%. The median dose was 78 Gy, and the median follow-up time was 50 (range, 1-190) months. Group V had increased mortality (sHR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-1.54), BF (sHR, 2.14; 0.88-1.83), and cause-specific mortality (sHR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.31-11). Acute toxicities were higher in group IV versus group I (genitourinary: 38% vs. 26%; P = .01; gastrointestinal: 21% vs. 5%; P = 001). Late toxicities were higher in groups IV and V versus group I (12%-14% vs. 2%-6%; P < .01). Men with T2DM not receiving medication and men with T2DM receiving insulin had worse outcomes and toxicities compared to other patients.",

A case-control study was conducted among a prospectively enrolled prostate biopsy cohort of 518 patients from Jan 2013 to Dec 2014 at our institute. Diabetes status and Metformin administration were determined through medical records and self-report. Different clinical characteristics were registered and compared among different groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of diabetes status and Metformin administration on the detection of overall as well as high-grade PCa at biopsy. PCa was detected in 229 (44.2%) men, and high-grade PCa (Gleason score ≥8) was detected in 65 (12.5%) men. Diabetes was observed in 96 men, and 28 of them were administered with Metformin. Both overall and high-grade cancer detection rates were significantly higher in diabetic patients (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, diabetes status was a risk factor for high-grade cancer detection (OR 7.699, 95%CI 3.483-17.020, p<0.001), but not for total PCa detection (OR 1.774, 95%CI 0.831-3.787, p=0.138). Meanwhile, Metformin administration was proved to be a protective factor for high-grade disease (OR 0.420, 95%CI 0.201-0.879, p=0.021) in multivariate analysis, while no correlation was detected with overall cancer detection (OR 0.786, 95%CI 0.172-3.593, p=0.756). Diabetes status was positively associated with biopsy-mediated high-grade PCa detection in Chinese population, while the positive association would be partly compromised by Metformin administration.",

Little is known about the effect of metformin on fetal development and growth. To compare the effect of metformin versus placebo on fetal growth and birth anthropometrics in PCOS offspring compared with a reference population in relation to maternal body mass index (BMI). Post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. 258 offspring born to mothers with PCOS. 2000 mg metformin (n = 131) or placebo (n = 121) from first trimester to delivery. Mean abdominal diameter and biparietal diameter (BPD) at gestational weeks 19 and 32. Head circumference (HC), birth length, and weight related to a reference population of healthy offspring, expressed as gestational age- and sex-adjusted z-scores. Metformin- versus placebo-exposed offspring had larger heads at gestational week 32 (BPD, 86.1 mm versus 85.2 mm; P = 0.03) and at birth (HC, 35.6 cm versus 35.1 cm; P < 0.01). Analyses stratified by maternal prepregnancy BMI, larger heads were observed only among offspring of overweight/obese mothers. Among normal-weight mothers, the effect of metformin compared with placebo was reduced length (z-score = -0.96 versus -0.42, P = 0.04) and weight (z-score = -0.44 versus 0.02; P = 0.03). Compared with the reference population, offspring born to PCOS mothers (placebo group) had reduced length (z-score = -0.40; 95% confidence interval, -0.60 to -0.40), but similar birth weight and HC. Metformin exposure resulted in larger head size in offspring of overweight mothers, traceable already in utero. Maternal prepregnancy BMI modified the effect of metformin on offspring anthropometrics. Anthropometrics of offspring born to PCOS mothers differed from those of the reference population.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between metformin use and prostate cancer risk remains controversial. Genetic variation in metformin metabolism pathways appears to modify metformin glycemic control and the protective association with some cancers. However, no studies to date have examined this pharmacogenetic interaction and prostate cancer chemoprevention. Clinical data and germline DNA were collected from our prostate biopsy database between 1996 and 2014. In addition to a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in metformin metabolism were included on a custom SNP array. Associations between metformin use and risk of high-grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) and overall prostate cancer were explored using a case-control design. Interaction between the candidate/GWAS SNPs and the metformin-cancer association was explored using a case-only design. Among 3481 men, 132 (4%) were taking metformin at diagnosis. Metformin users were older, more likely non-Caucasian, and had higher body mass index, Gleason score, and number of positive cores. Overall, 2061 (59%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 922 (45%) were high-grade. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, metformin use was associated with higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.02) and overall prostate cancer (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.03). None of the 27 candidate SNPs in metformin metabolic pathways had significant interaction with the metformin-cancer association. Among the GWAS SNPs, one SNP (rs149137006) had genome-wide significant interaction with metformin for high-grade prostate cancer, and another, rs115071742, for overall prostate cancer. They were intronic and intergenic SNPs, respectively, with largely uncharacterized roles in prostate cancer chemoprevention. In our cohort, metformin use was associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. While SNPs involved in metformin metabolism did not have modifying effects on the association with disease risk, one intronic and one intergenic SNP from the GWAS study did, and these require further study.",

Although type II DM and CRC are major health problems in the Middle East, no investigations have been performed to test the effect metformin has on the outcome of patients with type II DM and CRC who are also treated with metformin. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,902 patients diagnosed with CRC at King Hussein Cancer Center between January 2004 and December 2012, and identified 349 patients (18%) with type II DM; we censored the data of 28 patients because their antidiabetic medications were unknown. We then categorized these 321 patients into two groups: 192 patients treated with metformin (group A) and 129 patients treated with other antidiabetic medications (group B). Results Group A patients had significantly longer overall survival (89 months; 95% CI, 66 to 112 months) and progression-free survival (47 months; 95% CI, 15 to 79 months) than group B patients (overall survival: 36 months; 95% CI, 24 to 48 months; P ≤ .001; progression-free survival: 21 months; 95% CI, 13 to 29 months; P = .016). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, aspirin use, anticholesterol treatment, and CRC stage, group A patients had a 40% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.4% to 0.85%; P = .005). Conclusion Our results support findings from other populations that patients with diabetes and CRC who are also treated with metformin have better outcomes than those treated with other antidiabetic medications.",

Tumor response was analyzed with logistic regression to compare absolute and percent change in total tumor diameter (TTD) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank analysis. A total of 106 patients underwent 112 Y-90 RS, of which 40 were diabetic (38.8%) and 19 (18.4%) were on metformin. At baseline, the two groups of patients on metformin and not on metformin had no significant difference in age, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, ALBI grade, total tumor diameter, and size of dominant tumor. The only significant baseline difference was ECOG status. Uni- and multivariate analysis demonstrated a larger reduction in TTD and objective response by mRECIST criteria for patients undergoing Y-90 RS on metformin compared to those not on metformin. OS was similar between patients taking and not taking metformin (p = 0.912). Metformin may be associated with increased tumor response after Y-90 RS in patients with HCC. III, Retrospective Study.",

      "abstract": "Metformin activates AMP-related pathways leading to inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and suppression of its downstream effectors, crucial for cancer growth. Epidemiologic studies showed a reduced incidence and improved survival in cancer patients. We conducted a prospective phase I study to assess the safety of metformin in combination with chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors. We conducted a delayed-start randomized trial of non-diabetic patients in two stages. In Stage 1, we randomized patients to two arms: concurrent arm (metformin with chemo) vs. delayed arm (chemo alone). In Stage 2, patients in delayed arm were crossed over to receive metformin. Patients received metformin 500 mg twice daily with chemotherapy to define dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in both stages. Secondary endpoints assessed adverse events (AEs) and response rates. Translational correlates included effects of metformin on expression and phosphorylation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by western blot in PBMCs. A total of 100 patients were enrolled (51 in delayed arm vs. 49 concurrent arm). Rate of DLTs in patients receiving metformin with chemotherapy was 6.1% vs. 7.8% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. DLTs seen with addition of metformin included those associated with established chemo adverse events. No lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia occurred. Restaging showed stable disease in 46% at cessation of metformin. 28% of patients with measurable tumor markers showed improvement. AMPK phosphorylation showed a four- to sixfold increase in AMPK phosphorylation after metformin. This is the largest phase I study of metformin combined with chemotherapy, which suggests that metformin can be given safely with chemotherapy, and offers a platform for future studies. Post-metformin increase in AMPK phosphorylation may potentially explain lack of disease progression in nearly half of our patients. UL1 TR001064. NCT01442870.",

Gynecology Clinics of Mamji Hospital, Karachi, from 2008 to 2010. Patients who had been diagnosed Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) with hyperinsulinemia and conceived and continued pregnancy, were divided in two groups; 50 patients received metformin throughout pregnancy and 32 did not. Development of GDM was ascertained in both groups. The patients were followed throughout pregnancy and in puerperium with OGTT as per WHO criteria. Primary outcome measure was development of gestational diabetes mellitus. Comparison of continuous variables was done using student 't' test. For categorical variables, frequency and percentages are reported while, odds ratio is also estimated for GDM during pregnancy. A total of 82 women with PCOS were included in this study, out of whom, 50 patients received metformin treatment while 32 patients did not. Pregnant women with PCOS in both groups were comparable in age, weight, parity and BMI. Mean fasting insulin levels at beginning of study entry were 17.22 ± 2.3 mIU/L and 16.93 ± 2.28 mIU/L in metformin and no metformin group respectively (p=0.589). Mean fasting blood sugar levels were 94.54 mg/dl in metformin and 99.59 mg/dl in no metformin group p < 0.001. A total of 5 (10%) patients in metformin group developed GDM while 11 (34.37% OR 4.71, p = 0.01) developed GDM in no metformin group. Patients not receiving metformin were 4.7 times likely to have GDM (OR: 4.71) compared to those who received it. The frequency of gestational diabetes, was significantly higher in patients with PCOS who had not received metformin compared to those who did.",

Here, the effect of PC expression on PDAC tumorigenesis and metabolic reprogramming were evaluated. PC protein expression in PDAC and precancerous tissues was measured through immunohistochemistry. The maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) of <sup>18</sup>F-fluoro-2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) in PDAC patient PET/CT scans before surgical resection was retrospectively determined. Stable PC-knockdown and PC-overexpressing cells were established using lentiviruses, and PDAC progression was assessed in vivo and in vitro. Lactate content, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG cell uptake rate, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured in cells. RNA sequencing revealed and qPCR verified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after PC knockdown. The signaling pathways involved were determined by Western blotting. PC was significantly upregulated in PDAC tissues vs. precancerous tissues. A high SUVmax correlated with PC upregulation. PC knockdown significantly inhibited PDAC progression. Lactate content, SUVmax, and ECAR significantly decreased after PC knockdown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-one alpha (PGC-1α) was upregulated after PC knockdown; and PGC1a expression promoted AMPK phosphorylation to activate mitochondrial metabolism. Metformin significantly inhibited mitochondrial respiration after PC knockdown, further activated AMPK and downstream carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A)-regulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inhibited PDAC cells progression. PDAC cell uptake of FDG was positively correlated with PC expression. PC promotes PDAC glycolysis, and reducing PC expression can increase PGC1a expression, activate AMPK, and restore metformin sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.",

This population-based cohort study used claims data from the Korean National Health Insurance Database, 2014-2020. Two distinct cohorts were established to compare each incretin-based drug with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, chosen as active comparators because of their previous non-association with thyroid cancer, and their common usage as add-on therapy to metformin along with GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors. The first cohort included 21 722 new users of GLP-1RAs and 326 993 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors, whereas the second cohort included 904 300 DPP-4 inhibitor new users and 112 017 SGLT2 inhibitor new users. The outcome was the time to incident thyroid cancer. Weighted Cox proportional models were used to estimate hazard ratios of thyroid cancer incidence associated with incretin-based drugs of interest. The use of GLP-1RAs was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (weighted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.53) compared with that of SGLT2 inhibitors. Using DPP-4 inhibitors was also not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (0.95, 0.79-1.14) compared with that of SGLT2 inhibitors. No significant effect modifications were observed across subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses, including alternative outcome definition analysis of medullary thyroid cancer, were consistent with the primary analysis results. GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by inherited or de novo germline pathogenic variants in TP53. Individuals with LFS have a 70-100% lifetime risk of developing cancer. The current standard of care involves annual surveillance with whole-body and brain MRI (WB-MRI) and clinical review; however, there are no chemoprevention agents licensed for individuals with LFS. Preclinical studies in LFS murine models show that the anti-diabetic drug metformin is chemopreventive and, in a pilot intervention trial, short-term use of metformin was well-tolerated in adults with LFS. However, metformin's mechanism of anticancer activity in this context is unclear. Metformin in adults with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (MILI) is a Precision-Prevention phase II open-labelled unblinded randomised clinical trial in which 224 adults aged ≥ 16 years with LFS are randomised 1:1 to oral metformin (up to 2 mg daily) plus annual MRI surveillance or annual MRI surveillance alone for up to 5 years. The primary endpoint is to compare cumulative cancer-free survival up to 5 years (60 months) from randomisation between the intervention (metformin) and control (no metformin) arms. Secondary endpoints include a comparison of cumulative tumour-free survival at 5 years, overall survival at 5 years and clinical characteristics of emerging cancers between trial arms. Safety, toxicity and acceptability of metformin; impact of metformin on quality of life; and impact of baseline lifestyle risk factors on cancer incidence will be assessed. Exploratory end-points will evaluate the mechanism of action of metformin as a cancer preventative, identify biomarkers of response or carcinogenesis and assess WB-MRI performance as a diagnostic tool for detecting cancers in participants with LFS by assessing yield and diagnostic accuracy of WB-MRI. Alongside a parallel MILI study being conducted by collaborators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), MILI is the first prevention trial to be conducted in this high-risk group. The MILI study provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of metformin as a chemopreventive alongside exploring its mechanism of anticancer action and the biological process of mutated P53-driven tumourigenesis.

We examined the association between diabetes treatment (metformin versus sulfonylurea) and risk of incident diabetes-related and non- diabetes-related cancers in US veterans. This retrospective cohort study included US veterans, without cancer, aged ≥ 55 years, who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas for diabetes between 2001 to 2012. Cox proportional hazards models, with propensity score-matched inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were constructed. A total of 88,713 veterans (mean age 68.6 ± 7.8 years; 97.7% male; 84.1% White, 12.6% Black, 3.3% other race) were followed for 4.2 ± 3.0 years. Among metformin users (n = 60,476), there were 858 incident diabetes-related cancers (crude incidence rate [IR; per 1,000 person-years] = 3.4) and 3,533 non-diabetes-related cancers (IR = 14.1). Among sulfonylurea users (n = 28,237), there were 675 incident diabetes-related cancers (IR = 5.5) and 2,316 non-diabetes-related cancers (IR = 18.9). After IPTW adjustment, metformin use was associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes-related cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, 95% CI 0.58-0.75) compared to sulfonylurea use. There was no association between treatment group (metformin versus sulfonylurea) and non-diabetes-related cancer (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.02). Of diabetes-related cancers, metformin users had lower incidence of liver (HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.28-0.53), colorectal (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.92), and esophageal cancers (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.81). Among US veterans, metformin users had lower incidence of diabetes-related cancer, particularly liver, colorectal, and esophageal cancers, as compared to sulfonylurea users. Use of metformin was not associated with non-diabetes-related cancer. Further studies are needed to understand how metformin use impacts cancer incidence in different patient populations.",

In this time, correlations between metformin use and the occurrence of other disorders have been noted, as well as unpredictable metformin side effects. Diabetes is a significant cancer risk factor, but unexpectedly, metformin-treated diabetic patients have lower cancer incidence. Here, we show that metformin forms stable complexes with copper (II) ions. Both copper(I)/metformin and copper(II)/metformin complexes form adducts with glutathione, the main intracellular antioxidative peptide, found at high levels in cancer cells. Metformin reduces cell number and viability in SW1222 and K562 cells, as well as in K562-200 multidrug-resistant cells.

      "abstract": "Metformin is associated with reduced cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of metformin on cancer incidence in a consecutive series of insulin-treated patients. A nested case-control study was performed in a cohort of 1,340 patients by sampling, for each case subject, age-, sex-, and BMI-matched control subjects from the same cohort. During a median follow-up of 75.9 months, 112 case patients who developed incident cancer and were compared with 370 control subjects. A significantly lower proportion of case subjects were exposed to metformin and sulfonylureas. After adjustment for comorbidity, glargine, and total insulin doses, exposure to metformin, but not to sulfonylureas, was associated with reduced incidence of cancer (odds ratio 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.85], P = 0.014 and 0.75 [0.39-1.45], P = 0.40, respectively). The reduction of cancer risk could be a further relevant reason for maintaining use of metformin in insulin-treated patients.",

      "abstract": "Novel antidiabetic medications (SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 agonists) are commonly used worldwide; however, the available research lacks definitive conclusions on their protective effects or potential risks on cancer. Compared to other antidiabetics, our systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to use real-world studies to assess the potential cancer risks or protective effects of these novel antidiabetics. We comprehensively searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science from their inception until November 30, 2023. We included observational studies examining at least one novel antidiabetics in the systematic review. The novel antidiabetics include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1a). We focused on cohort studies that provided data on cancer incidence and sample size in the NMA. Using NetMetaXL<sup>®</sup>, the random effects model with informative priors was used in the NMA to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). The systematic review included 62 studies, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria for the NMA. SGLT-2i users had lower overall cancer risk compared to sulfonylureas (OR: 0.54; 95% CrI: 0.40-0.74, low certainty), GLP-1a (OR: 0.70; 95% CrI: 0.53-0.92, low certainty), and DPP-4i users (OR: 0.72; 95% CrI: 0.57-0.92, very low certainty). DPP-4i users also had a lower cancer risk than sulfonylureas users (OR: 0.76; 95% CrI: 0.60-0.96, low certainty). No other statistically significant ORs were found in other direct comparisons. SGLT-2i users have a lower risk of developing cancers than sulfonylureas, GLP-1a, and DPP-4i users. These results may improve patient safety by guiding future clinical practice and medication choices. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms behind these observed associations. This NMA was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023469941).",

The use of antidiabetic medication (ADM) may play an important role in the cancer development. The relationship between oral ADM and cancer incidence has not been investigated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in mainland China yet. A community-based diabetes cohort was extracted from the Shanghai Community Diabetes Management System database, which is a patient registry from general practices. The cohort included 2353 newly onset type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from 2006 to 2010 aged 35 years or more. Patients were grouped into nonusers of antidiabetic medication (n = 722), metformin monotherapy (n = 374), sulfonylurea monotherapy (n = 653), metformin and sulfonylurea combination therapy (n = 302), and other medication therapies (n = 302) on the basis of initial treatment type at registry entry. Cancer incidence was identified from the Shanghai Cancer Registry Organization. Comparisons between monotherapy and nonuser of medication were conducted using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 94 cancer cases were identified during 5 years median follow-up. Compared with nonusers, sulfonylurea monotherapy was associated with significantly lower risk of cancer [adjusted HR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.29-0.85)] whereas risk was 49% lower with metformin monotherapy [adjusted HR = 0.51 (95% CI 0.27-0.99)]. The real-world evidence suggested that the use of metformin or sulfonylurea was associated with lower risk of cancer incidence in a cohort of newly onset type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",

However, metabolic drug targeting is considered an underutilized and poorly understood area of cancer therapy. Metformin, a metabolic drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been associated with lower cancer incidence, although studies are inconclusive concerning effectiveness of the drug in treatment or cancer prevention. The aim of this study was to determine how glucose concentration influences cancer cells' response to metformin, highlighting why metformin studies are inconsistent. We used two colorectal cancer cell lines with different growth rates and clinically achievable metformin concentrations. We found that fast growing SW948 are more glycolytic in terms of metabolism, while the slower growing SW1116 are reliant on mitochondrial respiration. Both cell lines show inhibitory growth after metformin treatment under physiological glucose conditions, but not in high glucose conditions. Furthermore, SW1116 converges with SW948 at a more glycolytic phenotype after metformin treatment. This metabolic shift is supported by changed GLUT1 expression. Thus, cells having different metabolic phenotypes, show a clear differential response to metformin treatment based on glucose concentration. This demonstrates the importance of growth conditions for experiments or clinical studies involving metabolic drugs such as metformin.",

In this study, we evaluate the incidence of prostate cancer in diabetic patients treated with and without metformin compared with nondiabetic patients. One thousand thirty-four patients underwent transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy secondary to either an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or a prior biopsy finding of atypical small acinar proliferation/prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The cohort included 881 nondiabetic men, 65 diabetic men treated with metformin, and 88 diabetic men not receiving metformin. In metformin-treated patients, the median duration of usage was 6.0 years. Differences in prostate cancer diagnosis, histologic grade, and tumor volume were compared across the 3 cohorts. There was no statistically significant differences discerned between the 3 cohorts in patient age, prebiopsy PSA, prostate volume, PSA density, PSA doubling time, PSA velocity, or the total number of prior transrectal ultrasound biopsy sessions. Five hundred eighty-four patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. There was no difference in prostate cancer diagnosis (P=0.153), Gleason score (P=0.960), the number of positive biopsy cores (P=0.764), or risk group stratification (P=0.877) between the 3 cohorts. In multivariate analysis, only older age predicted for prostate cancer diagnosis. In terms of Gleason score ≥7, patient age, PSA velocity, and body mass index predicted for more aggressive histology. Neither diabetes, metformin use or duration was of statistical consequence. Metformin did not impact incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis, Gleason score distribution, or volume of disease.",

To avoid time-related biases, we evaluated the effect of treatment duration on the cancer risk among naive users of anti-diabetic medication as compared to non-users. In addition, we addressed the influence of common risk factors such as smoking and BMI. The study population comprised 23,394 participants of FINRISK surveys. Data on cancer and anti-diabetic medication were linked with the study cohorts. We applied Lexis tabulation to the data and analyzed split records by using Poisson regression. Changes in cancer incidence in relation to treatment duration were examined by modeling the rate ratio (RR). After a median follow-up of 9 years, 53 cancer cases among users of anti-diabetic medication and 1,028 among non-users were diagnosed. No significant difference in cancer risk between users and non-users was observed after adjustment. The RR for all medication regardless of its duration was 1.01 [95% CI 0.75-1.33], and 1.37 [0.94-1.94] for period of 1-4 years. The results were similar for metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin. This study demonstrates that evaluation of the variation in cancer risk in relation to treatment duration is of particular importance for enhancing the accuracy of conclusions on the link between exposure to anti-diabetic medication and cancer risk.",

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: PDAC) is one of the most aggressive neoplastic diseases. Metformin use has been associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence and better survival in diabetics. Metformin has been shown to inhibit PDAC cells growth and survival, both in vitro and in vivo. However, clinical trials using metformin have failed to reduce pancreatic cancer progression in patients, raising important questions about molecular mechanisms that protect tumor cells from the antineoplastic activities of metformin. We confirmed that metformin acts through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, decreasing the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, and that NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH homeostasis determines metformin sensitivity in several cancer cell lines. Metabolites that can restore the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio caused PDAC cells to be resistant to metformin. In addition, metformin treatment of PDAC cell lines induced a compensatory NAMPT expression, increasing the pool of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. The NAMPT inhibitor FK866 sensitized PDAC cells to the antiproliferative effects of metformin in vitro and decreased the cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pool. Intriguingly, FK866 combined with metformin increased survival in mice bearing KP4 cell line xenografts, but not in mice with PANC-1 cell line xenografts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the drug combination reactivated genes in the p53 pathway and oxidative stress, providing new insights about the mechanisms leading to cancer cell death.",

      "abstract": "Calotropis gigantea (L.) Dryand. (C. gigantea) is a traditional medicinal plant, recognized for its effectiveness in managing diabetes, along with its notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by chronic metabolic disorders associated with an elevated risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to hyperglycemia and impaired insulin response. The scientific validation of C. gigantea's ethnopharmacological efficacy offers advantages in alleviating cancer progression in T2DM complications, enriching existing knowledge and potentially aiding future clinical cancer treatments. This study aimed to investigate the preventive potential of the dichloromethane fraction of C. gigantea stem bark extract (CGDCM) against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in T2DM rats, aiming to reduce cancer incidence associated with diabetes while validating C. gigantea's ethnopharmacological efficacy. Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats were administered DEN to induce HCC (SDT-DEN-VEH), followed by treatment with CGDCM. Metformin was used as a positive control (SDT-DEN-MET). All the treatments were administered for 10 weeks after the initial DEN injection. Diabetes-related parameters, including serum levels of glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase), were quantified. Serum inflammation biomarkers interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were evaluated. Liver tissue samples were analyzed for inflammation protein expression (IL-6, TNF-α, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)). Histopathological evaluation was performed to assess hepatic necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Liver cell proliferation was determined using immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 expression. Rats with SDT-DEN-induced HCC treated with CGDCM exhibited reduced serum glucose levels, elevated insulin levels, and decreased HbA1c levels. CGDCM treatment also reduced elevated hepatic IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β1, and α-SMA levels in SDT-DEN-VEH rats. Additionally, CGDCM treatment prevented hepatocyte damage, fibrosis, and cell proliferation. No adverse effects on normal organs were observed with CGDCM treatment, suggesting its safety for the treatment of HCC complications associated with diabetes. Additionally, the absence of adverse effects in SD rats treated with CGDCM at 2.5 mg/kg further supports the notion of its safe usage. These findings suggest that C. gigantea stem bark extract exerts preventive effects against the development of HCC complications in patients with T2DM, expanding the potential benefits of its ethnopharmacological advantages.",

Studying the molecular changes associated with the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin we found that the oncogene <i>SOX4</i>, which is upregulated in solid tumors and associated with poor prognosis, was induced by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and blocked by Metformin. Wnt signaling inhibition by Metformin was surprisingly specific for cancer cells. Unraveling the underlying specificity, we identified Metformin and other Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) inhibitors as inducers of intracellular acidification in cancer cells. We demonstrated that acidification triggers the unfolded protein response to induce the global transcriptional repressor <i>DDIT3</i>, known to block Wnt signaling. Moreover, our results suggest that intracellular acidification universally inhibits Wnt signaling. Based on these findings, we combined MCI inhibitors with H<sup>+</sup> ionophores, to escalate cancer cells into intracellular hyper-acidification and ATP depletion. This treatment lowered intracellular pH both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model, depleted cellular ATP, blocked Wnt signaling, downregulated <i>SOX4</i>, and strongly decreased stemness and viability of cancer cells. Importantly, the inhibition of Wnt signaling occurred downstream of β-catenin, encouraging applications in treatment of cancers caused by <i>APC</i> and <i>β-catenin</i> mutations.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes as it disrupts cellular metabolism. Despite the association between metformin and lower cancer incidence, the anti-tumour activity of the drug in colorectal cancer (CRC) is incompletely understood. This study identifies underlying molecular mechanisms by which metformin slows colorectal cancer cell proliferation by investigating metformin-associated microRNA (miRNA) and target gene pairs implicated in signalling pathways. The present study analysed changes in miRNAs and the coding transcriptome in CRC cells treated with a sublethal dose of metformin, followed by the contextual validation of potential miRNA-target gene pairs. Analyses of small RNA and transcriptome sequencing data revealed 104 miRNAs and 1221 mRNAs to be differentially expressed in CRC cells treated with metformin for 72 h. Interaction networks between differentially expressed miRNAs and putative target mRNAs were identified. Differentially expressed genes were mainly implicated in metabolism and signalling processes, such as the PI3K-Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. Further validation of potential miRNA-target mRNA pairs revealed that metformin induced miR-2110 and miR-132-3p to target <i>PIK3R3</i> and, consequently, regulate CRC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Metformin also induced miR-222-3p and miR-589-3p, which directly target <i>STMN1</i> to inhibit CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. This study identified novel changes in the coding transcriptome and small non-coding RNAs associated with metformin treatment of CRC cells. Integration of these datasets highlighted underlying mechanisms by which metformin impedes cell proliferation in CRC. Importantly, it identified the post-transcriptional regulation of specific genes that impact both metabolism and cell proliferation.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a biguanide oral hypoglycaemic agent commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to its anti-diabetic effect, metformin has also been associated with a reduced risk of cancer incidence of a number of solid tumours, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the underlying biological mechanisms for these observations have not been fully characterised in PCa. One hypothesis is that the indirect insulin lowering effect may have an anti-neoplastic action as elevated insulin and insulin like growth factor - 1 (IGF-1) levels play a role in PCa development and progression. In addition, metformin is a potent activator of activated protein kinase (AMPK) which in turn inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other signal transduction mechanisms. These direct effects can lead to reduced cell proliferation. Given its wide availability and tolerable side effect profile, metformin represents an attractive potential therapeutic option for men with PCa. Hence, the need for a clinical trial investigating its biological mechanisms in PCa. METAL is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, window of opportunity study investigating the biological mechanism of metformin in PCa. 100 patients with newly-diagnosed, localised PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy will be randomised 1:1 to receive metformin (1 g b.d.) or placebo for four weeks (+/- 1 week) prior to prostatectomy. Tissue will be collected from both diagnostic biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. The primary endpoint is the difference in expression levels of markers of the Fatty acid synthase (FASN)/AMPK pathway pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms. Secondary endpoints include the difference in expression levels of indicators of proliferation (ki67 and TUNEL) pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms. METAL is currently open to recruitment at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. This randomised placebo-controlled double blinded trial of metformin vs. placebo in men with localised PCa due to undergo radical prostatectomy, aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of metformin in PCa cells, which should then enable further larger stratification trials to take place.

      "abstract": "The ovarian cancer risk factors of age and ovulation are curious because ovarian cancer incidence increases in postmenopausal women, long after ovulations have ceased. To determine how age and ovulation underlie ovarian cancer risk, we assessed the effects of these risk factors on the ovarian microenvironment. Aged C57/lcrfa mice (0-33 months old) were generated to assess the aged ovarian microenvironment. To expand our findings into human aging, we assembled a cohort of normal human ovaries (<i>n</i> = 18, 21-71 years old). To validate our findings, an independent cohort of normal human ovaries was assembled (<i>n</i> = 9, 41-82 years old). We first validated the presence of age-associated murine ovarian fibrosis. Using interdisciplinary methodologies, we provide novel evidence that ovarian fibrosis also develops in human postmenopausal ovaries across two independent cohorts (<i>n</i> = 27). Fibrotic ovaries have an increased CD206<sup>+</sup>:CD68<sup>+</sup> cell ratio, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration, and profibrotic DPP4<sup>+</sup>αSMA<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts. Metformin use was associated with attenuated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration and reduced CD206<sup>+</sup>:CD68<sup>+</sup> cell ratio. These data support a novel hypothesis that unifies the primary nonhereditary ovarian cancer risk factors through the development of ovarian fibrosis and the formation of a premetastatic niche, and suggests a potential use for metformin in ovarian cancer prophylaxis.<i>See related commentary by Madariaga et al., p. 523</i>.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is proposed as adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment because of its ability to limit cancer incidence by negatively modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In vitro, in addition to inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, metformin can also induce apoptosis. The molecular mechanism underlying this second effect is still poorly characterized and published data are often contrasting. We investigated how nutrient availability can modulate metformin-induced apoptosis in three breast cancer cell lines. MCF7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in MEM medium supplemented with increasing glucose concentrations or in DMEM medium and treated with 10 mM metformin. Cell viability was monitored by Trypan Blue assay and treatment effects on Akt/mTOR pathway and on apoptosis were analysed by Western Blot. Moreover, we determined the level of expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a well-known glycolytic enzyme expressed in cancer cells. Our results showed that metformin can induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells when cultured at physiological glucose concentrations and that the pro-apoptotic effect was completely abolished when cells were grown in high glucose/high amino acid medium. Induction of apoptosis was found to be dependent on AMPK activation but, at least partially, independent of TORC1 inactivation. Finally, we showed that, in nutrient-poor conditions, metformin was able to modulate the intracellular glycolytic equilibrium by downregulating PKM2 expression and that this mechanism was mediated by AMPK activation. We demonstrated that metformin induces breast cancer cell apoptosis and PKM2 downregulation only in nutrient-poor conditions. Not only glucose levels but also amino acid concentration can influence the observed metformin inhibitory effect on the mTOR pathway as well as its pro-apoptotic effect. These data demonstrate that the reduction of nutrient supply in tumors can increase metformin efficacy and that modulation of PKM2 expression/activity could be a promising strategy to boost metformin anti-cancer effect.",

Data from 4,314 men aged 55-70 years from a population-based PSA-screening trial (ERSPC Aarau) were analyzed. Information on metformin exposure was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. Serum PSA threshold at ≥3 ng/ml triggered prostate biopsy. Data on PCa incidence and mortality were obtained through registry linkages. Median follow-up time was 7.6 years. Mean age at baseline was 65.5 years (±SD 4.4). In all, n = 150 (3.5 %) men used metformin [metf+]. Mean baseline PSA levels were comparable between both groups ([metf+] 1.6 ng/ml ± 2.4 vs. [metf-] 1.8ug/l ± 2.2, p = 0.4) while f/t-ratio was slightly higher in metformin users ([metf+] 30.7 % ± 10.9 vs. [metf-] 27.3 % ± 10.9, p = 0.01). Overall, n = 372 (8.6 %) PCa cases were detected. Neither cumulative PCa incidence (n = 11; 7.3 % [metf+] vs. n = 361 8.7 % [metf-]; p = 0.5) nor d`Amico risk groups were significantly different between both groups. One man in each group (metf+ 0.7 % and metf- 0.02 %) died from PCa (p < 0.0001), respectively. All-cause mortality was significantly higher among met + compared to met- (adjusted OR 2.50, 95 %CI 1.59-3.82; p = 0.0001). No significant differences in PSA levels or PCa incidence and grade were observed. The slightly higher f/t-ratio did not result in lower PCa detection rate. Metformin users were at significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality. The relatively small number of men on metformin is a main limitation of the study.",

We performed a PubMed and EMbase search for all available studies that described the risk of breast cancer and all-cause mortality in relation to the use of metformin among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were determined using a random effects model to assess the strength of association between metformin and the risk of breast cancer. Fifteen articles from PubMed satisfied the inclusion criteria, including a total of 838,333 participants. Compared with the control group, metformin use was not related to a reduced incidence of breast cancer (RR, 0.964; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.761-1.221; p=0.761). However, metformin therapy was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.488-0.873; p=0.004). No obvious publication bias was detected (incidence: p Begg=0.755, p Egger=0.008; mortality: p Begg=0.072, p Egger=0.185). The present study suggested that metformin therapy may decrease the all-cause mortality of patients affected by breast cancer.

It is also used in the treatment of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This disease is related to insulin resistance and multiplied blood sugar ranges. Furthermore, it has been established that the use of metformin improves the menstrual cycles and ovulation rates of these women. A structured questionnaire was conducted to determine the prevalence of breast cancer among women using metformin in the Ha'il region. The incidence of breast cancer among women using metformin in the Ha'il region is very low. Thus, it can be said that breast cancer cases declined among diabetics taking metformin. This means that metformin use is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in women with type 2 diabetes, even in cases where these women have a family history of breast cancer. According to previous findings, metformin has been linked to lower breast cancer risk in women with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the findings of this study corroborate the literature on this subject by indicating that there is a substantial connection between metformin use and a lower risk of breast cancer in women with type 2 diabetes. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are crucial to investigate the protective effect of metformin against breast cancer and to confirm our findings.",

Metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic drug, has been shown to be protective against different types of cancers; however, its role in esophageal cancer is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether the use of metformin modifies the risk of development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett esophagus. Patients with diagnoses of Barrett esophagus and esophageal cancer were identified during a 20-year period. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The outcome variable was esophageal adenocarcinoma. Univariate analysis was performed using two-sample t tests for continuous variables or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was then performed using the significant variables. A total of 583 patients were identified with the diagnosis of Barrett esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma from 1992 to 2012. Of these, 115 had esophageal adenocarcinoma and 468 had Barrett esophagus. Age, smoking, and diabetes mellitus were found to be significant risk factors for the development of esophageal cancer with the following results: age (P < 0.001), smoking (P = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.007). Statin use was protective against the development of cancer with P = 0.001. Metformin use was neither associated with an increased nor a decreased risk of esophageal cancer. The three independent variables that predicted progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma in our study were older age, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Statin use showed protective effect against development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Metformin use did not demonstrate any statistically significant protective effect.",

      "abstract": "Observational studies have demonstrated association of metformin with reduced cancer incidence and mortality in multiple cancer types, including gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Anti-neoplastic effects of metformin are believed through many mechanisms including activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which controls mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) growth regulatory pathway. In a pilot, delayed-start randomized study, non-diabetic patients with GI cancers were randomized to 2 arms, Stage 1: concurrent metformin (500mg twice daily) plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone followed by cross over to metformin plus chemotherapy arm in Stage 2, while adverse events (DLT) were assessed by CTCAE v.3.0. As a translational correlate, we used phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr172 to measure AMPK activation by western blot technique in PBMCs isolated from patients before and after receiving M. These levels were correlated with radiological (RECIST 1.1) and tumor marker outcomes by descriptive analysis. In this study, we present the sub-group analysis of patients with GI cancers. 41 patients with GI cancers (colorectal: 22, pancreatic: 12, gastroesophageal: 4, biliary: 2, others: 1) were treated in this trial. Mean duration of metformin therapy was 85 days (range: 9-443). There was no significant difference in grade 3 or above DLT in metformin plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy arm (14% vs. 12% respectively). Gel band density analysis on 19 patients showed that 63% patients had increased phosphorylation of AMPKα after metformin (ratio of phospho-AMPKα after and before metformin > 1) with mean = 1.227 (± 0.134). RECIST 1.1 restaging showed disease control in 55% patients and 45% patients had decline in tumor markers. Of note, 60% of patients with disease control also showed increase in phosphorylation of AMKα. This group of patients treated with metformin prospectively demonstrates the impact of metformin on AMPKα phosphorylation, and correlates with clinical benefit in patients with GI cancers when metformin was added to systemic chemotherapy of varying types. We aim to perform a dose-escalation of metformin in our next study with additional metabolomics correlates.",

Lifestyle change could potentially reduce cancer incidence. The objective was to determine whether metformin or intensive lifestyle (ILS) intervention reduces the risk of cancer among adults at high risk of diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (1996-2001) randomized 3,234 participants to ILS, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or blinded placebo. During follow-up through the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, all participants were offered a modified lifestyle intervention, and metformin continued in an open-label metformin group. Participants reported cancer cases annually. Medical records were adjudicated for all reported events. The primary endpoint was total cancer incidence, comparing metformin versus placebo, with ILS versus placebo as a secondary objective. After a median follow-up of 21 years, 546 participants (173 metformin, 182 ILS, and 191 placebo) were diagnosed with a first incident cancer. Incidence rates of cancer were 9.8, 10.5, and 10.8 per 1,000 person-years in metformin, ILS, and placebo, respectively, with a HR of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.10) for metformin compared with placebo and 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.18) for ILS compared with placebo. There were no differences between any treatment groups for obesity-related cancer or in sex-specific analyses. Neither assignment to metformin nor ILS reduced cancer incidence among adults at high risk of diabetes. These results may be impacted by increased nonstudy metformin usage over time due to the development of diabetes and reduced intensity of the ILS intervention over time. This study examines both metformin and ILS intervention as primary cancer prevention interventions in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",

We studied the incidence of lung cancer in patients who received metformin therapy. This study was retrospectively designed and based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort to determine whether metformin reduces lung cancer risk in the diabetic population. At baseline, all participants were 40 to 69 years old and were categorized into 3 groups: metformin nonrecipients with DM, metformin recipients with DM, and the nondiabetic group. A total of 336,168 individuals were included in the final analysis (314,291 nondiabetic individuals, 8806 metformin recipients, and 13,071 metformin nonrecipients). The study median follow-up period was 12.86 years. The estimated cumulative lung cancer incidence of metformin nonrecipients, metformin recipients, and the nondiabetic group was 1.80%, 1.97%, and 1.24% in men and 1.87%, 0.61%, and 0.41% in women, respectively (P < .05). Compared to metformin nonrecipients, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for lung cancer incidence of metformin recipients and the nondiabetic group were 1.287 (0.979-1.691) and 0.835 (0.684-1.019) in men and 0.664 (0.374-1.177) and 0.553 (0.359-0.890) in women, respectively. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were statistically significant in male ever smokers (0.784 [0.627-0.979]) and female nonsmokers (0.498 [0.320-0.774]) after stratification according to smoking status. Metformin therapy did not reduce lung cancer incidence in the diabetic population. However, individuals without DM were at a lower risk of lung cancer, especially in male ever smokers and female nonsmokers.",

Metformin increases levels of activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and decreases circulating IGF-1; encouraging its potential use in both cancer prevention and therapeutic settings. In anticipation of clinical trials in nondiabetic women, the efficacy of metformin in nondiabetic rat and mouse mammary cancer models was evaluated. Metformin was administered by gavage or in the diet, at a human equivalent dose, in standard mammary cancer models: (i) methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) mammary cancers in rats, and (ii) MMTV-Neu/p53KO ER(-) (estrogen receptor-negative) mammary cancers in mice. In the MNU rat model, metformin dosing (150 or 50 mg/kg BW/d, by gavage) was ineffective in decreasing mammary cancer multiplicity, latency, or weight. Pharmacokinetic studies of metformin (150 mg/kg BW/d, by gavage) yielded plasma levels (Cmax and AUC) higher than humans taking 1.5 g/d. In rats bearing small palpable mammary cancers, short-term metformin (150 mg/kg BW/d) treatment increased levels of phospho-AMPK and phospho-p53 (Ser20), but failed to reduce Ki67 labeling or expression of proliferation-related genes. In the mouse model, dietary metformin (1,500 mg/kg diet) did not alter final cancer incidence, multiplicity, or weight. Metformin did not prevent mammary carcinogenesis in two mammary cancer models, raising questions about metformin efficacy in breast cancer in nondiabetic populations.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a prevalent malignancy that is a major health problem for women worldwide. The cancer-preventive properties of metformin are well-known, but insufficient data have been reported regarding its relationship to cervical cancer. Therefore, in a nationwide population-based study, we investigated the association between metformin use and cervical cancer incidence in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This retrospective cohort study used the Korean National Health Insurance claims database. Individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between January 2005 and December 2009 were included. The occurrence of cervical cancer was explored by matching for age, economic status, region of residence, and use of anti-diabetic medication. In total, 66,013 metformin users and 64,756 non-users were analyzed. Cervical cancer occurred in 219 metformin users (0.33%) and 274 metformin non-users (0.42%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.783; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.655 to 0.036; P=0.007). Moreover, cervical cancer risk was considerably reduced in those treated with a high dose (>1,200,000 mg) or for an extended period (≥2,000 days) compared to non-users (HR, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.093 to 0.243; P<0.001; and HR, 0.141; 95% CI, 0.077 to 0.258; P<0.001). The incidence was also significantly lower in metformin users among those over 50 years old (HR, 0.791; 95% CI, 0.650 to 0.961; P<0.001). Metformin use in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes was associated with a lower risk of cervical cancer in Korea. Furthermore, a significant association was found between the use of metformin and cervical cancer in a dose- and duration-dependent manner and among those over 50 years old.",

Metformin exhibits antiproliferative and antineoplastic effects associated with inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We provide a unique genome-wide analysis of translational targets of canonical mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and PP242) compared with metformin, revealing that metformin controls gene expression at the level of mRNA translation to an extent comparable to that of canonical mTOR inhibitors. Importantly, metformin's antiproliferative activity can be explained by selective translational suppression of mRNAs encoding cell-cycle regulators via the mTORC1/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein pathway. Thus, metformin selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding proteins that promote neoplastic proliferation, which should facilitate studies on metformin and related biguanides in cancer prevention and treatment.",

There are ongoing clinical trials to evaluate its antitumor properties, which may relate to its fundamental activity as an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we show that serine withdrawal increases the antineoplastic effects of phenformin (a potent biguanide structurally related to metformin). Serine synthesis was not inhibited by biguanides. Instead, metabolic studies indicated a requirement for serine to allow cells to compensate for biguanide-induced decrease in oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating glycolysis. Furthermore, serine deprivation modified the impact of metformin on the relative abundance of metabolites within the citric acid cycle. In mice, a serine-deficient diet reduced serine levels in tumors and significantly enhanced the tumor growth-inhibitory actions of biguanide treatment. Our results define a dietary manipulation that can enhance the efficacy of biguanides as antineoplastic agents that target cancer cell energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) often causes chronic inflammation of the liver with an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV-infected individuals may also have an increased incidence of nonliver cancers. Taking statin or metformin may decrease inflammation and infiltration, which may, as a result, reduce the risk of liver cancer or other major cancers in patients with HBV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that statin and metformin could reduce the incidence of liver cancer (HCC) or nonliver cancers in patients with HBV.Using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 to 2008, this cohort study comprised patients with a recorded diagnosis of HBV (N = 71,847) between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008. Each patient was followed-up until the end of 2008. The occurrence of HCC or a nonliver cancer was evaluated in patients who either were or were not taking statin or metformin. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to evaluate the cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors.In total, 71,824 HBV-infected patients comprised the study cohort. Our study showed that either metformin or statin use was associated with a reduction in the incidence of cancer. This was most prominent in patients taking both statin and metformin. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for patients using only statin were 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.57) for all cancers, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.23-0.35) for liver cancer, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.57-0.70) for nonliver cancers. Patients taking only metformin had risk-adjusted HRs of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75-0.90) for all cancers, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.14) for liver cancer, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.84) for nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of statin use for chemoprevention was observed for all cancers, including both liver cancer and nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of metformin was also seen in liver cancer and nonliver cancers without stratification into different cumulative daily doses of statin use.This population-based cohort study investigated the protective effect of statin and metformin against cancer events in patients with HBV infection. Our study demonstrated that either statin or metformin served as independent chemopreventive agents with a dose-response effect in reducing the incidence of cancer with a dose-response effect of the agents and an additive or synergistic effect of combining statin and metformin use in reducing the incidence of many cancers.",

      "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the key biological phenomena behind cancer and metastasis. Clinical studies suggest that patients undergoing metformin therapy are less predisposed to cancer but the underlying mechanism is far from clear. Given that metformin also acts as TGF-β inhibitor, we sought to explore whether and how metformin could modulate EMT in a cancer like microenvironment. Our data using human cell lines revealed that metformin induced a distinct change from stromal-shaped mesenchymal cells to cuboidal-shaped epithelial cells with upregulation of epithelial markers and mitigation of their invasive property. One of the key regulatory pathways, which intersect tumorigenesis and metformin activity, is AMPK. We demonstrated that metformin attenuates ERK signaling by activating AMPK pathway leading to suppression of Snail and Slug resulting in upregulation of crucial tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin. ChIP assay confirmed insufficient binding of repressors like Slug to the E-cadherin promoter. Further, our data revealed reduction in HDAC activity prompting hypomethylation of E-cadherin promoter thus reflecting an epigenetic modification. To expand the translational significance of the study we verified these findings in diabetic patients undergoing metformin treatment. To our knowledge this is the first report representing an inverse relationship of AMPK and ERK signaling axis in promoting mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) via re-expression of E-cadherin upon metformin treatment thus rationalizing lower incidence of cancer in metformin-administered patients. Metformin promotes reversal of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Metformin attenuates ERK signaling by activating AMP kinase. Metformin induces hypomethylation of the E-cadherin gene promoter. Epigenetic modification of the E-cadherin promoter was observed in leukocytes from diabetic subjects. These findings provide a potential basis for decreased cancer incidence in metformin-treated subjects.",

      "abstract": "The sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin are recently approved medications for type 2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors may inhibit the growth of some cancer cells but the mechanism(s) remain unclear. Cellular proliferation and clonogenic survival were used to assess the sensitivity of prostate and lung cancer cell growth to the SGLT2 inhibitors. Oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification rate, cellular ATP, glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the p70S6 kinase were assessed. Overexpression of a protein that maintains complex-I supported mitochondrial respiration (NDI1) was used to establish the importance of this pathway for mediating the anti-proliferative effects of Canagliflozin. Clinically achievable concentrations of Canagliflozin, but not Dapagliflozin, inhibit cellular proliferation and clonogenic survival of prostate and lung cancer cells alone and in combination with ionizing radiation and the chemotherapy Docetaxel. Canagliflozin reduced glucose uptake, mitochondrial complex-I supported respiration, ATP, and lipogenesis while increasing the activating phosphorylation of AMPK. The overexpression of NDI1 blocked the anti-proliferative effects of Canagliflozin indicating reductions in mitochondrial respiration are critical for anti-proliferative actions. These data indicate that like the biguanide metformin, Canagliflozin not only lowers blood glucose but also inhibits complex-I supported respiration and cellular proliferation in prostate and lung cancer cells. These observations support the initiation of studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of Canagliflozin on limiting tumorigenesis in pre-clinical animal models as well epidemiological studies on cancer incidence relative to other glucose lowering therapies in clinical populations.",

This is a retrospective cohort analysis using the National Health Insurance database of Taiwan. Female patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and without endometrial cancer in 1998-2002 were followed to end of 2009 (n=478,921). Among them, 285,916 were never-users and 193,005 were ever-users of metformin. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate endometrial cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios by Cox regression for ever-users, never-users, and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in various subgroups. During follow-up, 728 metformin ever-users and 2157 never-users developed endometrial cancer, representing an incidence of 60.00 and 121.69 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for ever- versus never-users after adjustment for propensity score (PS) was 0.675 (0.614-0.742). The PS-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second, and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 1.089 (0.966-1.228), 0.707 (0.616-0.812) and 0.313 (0.262-0.374), respectively (P-trend<0.0001); and 1.062 (0.942-1.197), 0.620 (0.538-0.715) and 0.376 (0.317-0.447), respectively (P-trend<0.0001), for cumulative dose of metformin. The dose-response relationship was demonstrated in various models and an overall reduced risk was consistently supported by sensitivity analyses. The use of metformin in women with T2DM was associated with an overall significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer with dose-response relationship.",

Uncertainty exists regarding which patient populations and/or tumor subtypes will benefit from metformin treatment, and most preclinical <i>in vivo</i> studies have given little attention to the cellular pharmacology of intratumoral metformin uptake. Epidemiologic reports consistently link western-style high fat diets (HFD), which drive overweight and obesity, with increased risk of breast cancer. We used a rat model of HFD-induced overweight and mammary carcinogenesis to define intratumoral factors that confer metformin sensitivity. Mammary tumors were initiated with 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea, and rats were randomized into metformin-treated (2 mg/mL drinking water) or control groups (water only) for 8 weeks. Two-thirds of existing mammary tumors responded to metformin treatment with decreased tumor volumes (<i>P</i> < 0.05), reduced proliferative index (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and activated AMPK (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Highly responsive tumors accumulated 3-fold greater metformin amounts (<i>P</i> < 0.05) that were positively correlated with organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2) protein expression (<i>r</i> = 0.57; <i>P</i> = 0.038). Importantly, intratumoral metformin concentration negatively associated with tumor volume (<i>P</i> = 0.03), and each 10 pmol increase in intratumoral metformin predicted >0.11 cm<sup>3</sup> reduction in tumor volume. Metformin treatment also decreased proinflammatory arachidonic acid >1.5-fold in responsive tumors (<i>P</i> = 0.023). Collectively, these preclinical data provide evidence for a direct effect of metformin <i>in vivo</i> and suggest that OCT2 expression may predict metformin uptake and tumor response. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(3); 198-207. ©2017 AACR</i>.",

Although epidemiologic data have provided a strong rationale for investigating the potential of this biguanide for use in cancer prevention and control, uncertainty exists whether metformin should be expected to have an impact in nondiabetic patients. Furthermore, little attention has been given to the possibility that other biguanides may have anticancer activity. In this study, the effects of clinically relevant doses of metformin (9.3 mmol/kg diet), buformin (7.6 mmol/kg diet), and phenformin (5.0 mmol/kg diet) were compared with rats fed control diet (AIN93-G) during the post-initiation stage of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea-induced (50 mg/kg body weight) mammary carcinogenesis (n = 30/group). Plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, mammary gland, and mammary carcinoma concentrations of the biguanides were determined. In comparison with the control group, buformin decreased cancer incidence, multiplicity, and burden, whereas metformin and phenformin had no statistically significant effect on the carcinogenic process relative to the control group. Buformin did not alter fasting plasma glucose or insulin. Within mammary carcinomas, evidence was obtained that buformin treatment perturbed signaling pathways related to energy sensing. However, further investigation is needed to determine the relative contributions of host systemic and cell autonomous mechanisms to the anticancer activity of biguanides such as buformin.",

We followed 185,181 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1994-2016) and the NHSII (1995-2017), with baseline corresponding to the date metformin was approved for type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment in the US Information on T2D diagnosis, anti-diabetes medications, and other covariates was self-reported at baseline and repeatedly assessed by follow-up questionnaires every 2 years. Breast cancer cases were self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between medication use and breast cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. During 3,324,881 person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 9,192 incident invasive breast cancer cases, of which 451 were among women with T2D. Compared with women without T2D (n = 169,263), neither metformin use (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.81-1.15) nor other anti-diabetic medications use (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.90-1.36) associated with significantly lower breast cancer incidence. Among women with T2D (n = 15,918), compared with metformin never users, metformin ever use was not significantly inversely associated with breast cancer (HR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.74-1.15). Although we observed that past use of metformin was inversely associated with breast cancer in the T2D population (HR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.48-0.94), current use (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.80-1.27) and longer duration of metformin use were not associated with breast cancer (each 2-year interval: HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.95-1.07).

      "abstract": "Recent observational studies have shown that metformin use in diabetic patients decreases both cancer incidence and mortality. Metformin use is also independently predictive of pathologic complete response. In the current study, the authors explored the association between metformin use and survival outcomes in patients with triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The Breast Cancer Management System database of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center identified 1448 women who received adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC between 1995 and 2007. Patients were categorized by diabetes status and metformin use. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine the association between metformin use and survival outcomes. The study cohort was comprised of 63 diabetic patients receiving treatment with metformin, 67 diabetic patients not receiving metformin, and 1318 nondiabetic patients. Patients in the diabetic groups tended to be older (P = .005); more diabetic patients were postmenopausal (P = .0007), black (P = .0001), and obese (P < .0001). At a median follow-up of 62 months, there were no significant differences with regard to 5-year DMFS (P = .23), RFS (P = .38), and OS (P = .58) between the 3 groups. Compared with the metformin group, patients who did not receive metformin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.87-3.06 [P = .13]) and nondiabetic patients (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.97-2.71 [P = .06]) tended to have a higher risk of distant metastases. The findings of the current study suggest that metformin use during adjuvant chemotherapy does not significantly impact survival outcomes in diabetic patients with TNBC.",

This study investigated whether human insulin use might be associated with breast cancer risk in Taiwanese women with type 2 diabetes. The reimbursement databases of all Taiwanese diabetic patients from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2004 and a total of 482,033 women with type 2 diabetes were followed up for breast cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of human insulin exposure (using tertile cutoffs of time since starting insulin, cumulative dose and cumulative duration of insulin) were calculated and the adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression. The potential risk modification by concomitant treatment with metformin, statin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) was also evaluated. There were 59,798 ever-users and 422,235 never-users of human insulin, with respective numbers of incident breast cancer of 559 (0.93 %) and 4,711 (1.12 %), and respective incidence of 207.9 and 215.1 per 100,000 person-years. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) did not show a significant association with insulin [1.033 (0.936-1.139)]. However, patients in the third tertiles of dose-response parameters might show a significantly higher risk of breast cancer while compared to never-users: 1.185 (1.026-1.368), 1.260 (1.096-1.450) and 1.257 (1.094-1.446) for ≥67 months for time since starting insulin, ≥39,000 units for cumulative dose of insulin, and ≥21.8 months for cumulative duration of insulin, respectively. Additional analyses suggested that the breast cancer risk associated with human insulin use might be beneficially modified by concomitant use of metformin, statin and ACEI/ARB. This study discloses a significantly higher risk of breast cancer associated with prolonged use of human insulin. The increased risk of breast cancer associated with human insulin use may be modified by medications such as metformin, statin and ACEI/ARB.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several studies reported that the cancer incidence in type 2 diabetes patients is higher than in the general population. Although a number of risks are shared between cancer and diabetes patients, there have been few studies of its correlation. We evaluated the influences of several factors including low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), albuminuria and use of metformin on the risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. We enrolled 1,320 patients with at least 5 years of follow-up and 73 patients were diagnosed with cancer during this period. The associations of the risk factors with cancer incidence were evaluated by multiple regression analysis. The subjects were placed into two subgroups based on metformin dosage (<1,000 mg/day, ≥1,000 mg/day) and we compared cancer incidence using analysis of covariance. LDL-C and albuminuria were not significantly correlated with cancer risk. In contrast, metformin showed a reverse correlation with cancer risk (P=0.006; relative risk, 0.574). In the metformin nonadministration group, smoking, male gender, and high triglyceride levels tended to be contributing factors without statistical significance. Cancer occurence was lower in the low dose metformin group (less than 1,000 mg/day) (P=0.00). These results suggest that the administration of low dose metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer.",

      "abstract": "There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between metformin use and cancer risk in diabetic patients. During 2002-2012, we followed a cohort of 315,890 persons aged 21-87 years with incident diabetes who were insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We used a discrete form of weighted cumulative metformin exposure to evaluate the association of metformin with cancer incidence. This was implemented in a time-dependent covariate Cox model, adjusting for treatment with other glucose-lowering medications, as well as age, sex, ethnic background, socioeconomic status, smoking (for bladder and lung cancer), and parity (for breast cancer). We excluded from the analysis metformin exposure during the year before cancer diagnosis in order to minimize reverse causation of cancer on changes in medication use. Estimated hazard ratios associated with exposure to 1 defined daily dose of metformin over the previous 2-7 years were 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 1.18) for all-sites cancer (excluding prostate and pancreas), 1.05 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.63) for colon cancer, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.97) for bladder cancer, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.78) for lung cancer, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.39) for female breast cancer. Our results do not support an association between metformin treatment and the incidence of major cancers (excluding prostate and pancreas).",

      "abstract": "Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, while DNA-damaging ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun remains the major environmental risk factor. Reducing skin cancer incidence is becoming an urgent issue. The energy-sensing enzyme 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a key role in the regulation of cellular lipid and protein metabolism in response to stimuli such as exercise and changes in fuel availability. However, the role of AMPK in the response of skin cells to UVB damage and in skin cancer prevention remains unknown. Here we show that AMPK activation is reduced in human and mouse squamous cell carcinoma as compared with normal skin, and by UVB irradiation, suggesting that AMPK is a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, AMPK deletion reduced the expression of the DNA repair protein xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) and UVB-induced DNA repair. AMPK activation by its activators AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) and metformin (N',N'-dimethylbiguanide), the most widely used antidiabetic drug, increased the expression of XPC and UVB-induced DNA repair in mouse skin, normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and AMPK wild-type (WT) cells but not in AMPK-deficient cells, indicating an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Topical treatment with AICAR and metformin not only delayed onset of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis but also reduced tumor multiplicity. Furthermore, AMPK deletion increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and cell proliferation, whereas AICAR and metformin inhibited ERK activation and cell proliferation in keratinocytes, mouse skin, AMPK WT and AMPK-deficient cells, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism. Finally, in UVB-damaged tumor-bearing mice, both topical and systemic metformin prevented the formation of new tumors and suppressed growth of established tumors. Our findings not only suggest that AMPK is a tumor suppressor in the skin by promoting DNA repair and controlling cell proliferation, but also demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms by which the AMPK activators prevent UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between metformin use and pancreatic cancer risk in the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-National Health Screening Cohort (HEALS). Of the individuals in the Korean NHIS-HEALS, 29,271 men and 19,091 women were included in the final analysis after propensity score matching based on age, body mass index, and smoking status. The study population was categorized into three groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM, and non-diabetic users. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the association between metformin use and pancreatic cancer. The median follow-up period was 12.9 years. The estimated pancreatic cancer incidence was highest in metformin users with DM, regardless of sex (P<0.001), and lowest in non-diabetic men and female metformin non-users (P=0.053). The hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for pancreatic cancer incidence in metformin users and non-diabetic individuals were 1.116 (0.648-1.923) and 0.447 (0.259-0.771) in men and 2.769 (1.003-7.642) and 1.451 (0.529-3.984) in women, respectively, after full adjustment. Women with diabetes using metformin are at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than women with diabetes not using metformin. Meanwhile, men with DM using metformin have a similar risk of pancreatic cancer as men with DM not using metformin.",

However, previous observational studies have reported contradictory results, which are likely due to important methodologic limitations. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess whether the use of metformin is associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with type II diabetes. A cohort study of patients newly treated with non-insulin antidiabetic agents was assembled using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where all incident cases of colorectal cancer occurring during follow-up were identified and randomly matched with up to 10 controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RR) of colorectal cancer associated with ever use, and cumulative duration of use of metformin. All models accounted for latency and were adjusted for relevant potential confounding factors. Overall, ever use of metformin was not associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer [RR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-1.18]. Similarly, no dose-response relationship was observed in terms of cumulative duration of use. The use of metformin was not associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with type II diabetes. The results of this study do not support the launch of metformin randomized controlled trials for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.",

Here we report effects of metformin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep-G2 cells and details of molecular mechanisms of metformin activity. Our research indicates that metformin displays anticancer activity against HCC through inhibition of the mTOR translational pathway in an AMPK-independent manner, leading to G1 arrest in the cell-cycle and subsequent cell apoptosis through the mitochondrion-dependent pathway. Furthermore, we showed that metformin strongly attenuated colony formation and dramatically inhibited Hep-G2 tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, our studies suggested that metformin might have potential as a cytotoxic drug in the prevention and treatment of HCC.",

This emerges from observational studies that diabetic women treated with metformin in comparison to other antidiabetic compounds had lower breast cancer incidence and/or mortality rates. The mechanism of action is considered to be activation of hepatic AMPK resulting in reduced gluconeogenesis. Calorie restriction, which consistently reduces mammary tumorigenesis in rodents, is also thought to act through this pathway leading to the hypothesis that metformin's anticancer effects are mediated in a similar fashion. Here we review the literature evaluating metformin's anticancer effects in relation to breast/mammary tumorigenesis. We include clinical observations, as well as studies utilizing rodent models and mammary cell lines. In addition to the anticancer effect of metformin mediated through the AMPK pathway, additional mechanisms of action that directly target tissues have been identified including effects on stem cells, apoptosis, STAT3 and HER2.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that diabetes is a risk factor for endometrial cancer incidence. However, most of these studies used case-control study designs and did not adjust for obesity, an established risk factor for endometrial cancer. In addition, few epidemiological studies have examined the association between diabetes treatment and endometrial cancer risk. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships among diabetes, diabetes treatment and endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). A total of 88 107 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years who were free of cancer and had no hysterectomy at baseline were followed until date of endometrial cancer diagnosis, death, hysterectomy or loss to follow-up, whichever came first. Endometrial cancers were confirmed by central medical record and pathology report review. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for diagnosis of diabetes and metformin treatment as risk factors for endometrial cancer. Over a mean of 11 years of follow-up, 1241 endometrial cancers developed. In the primary analysis that focused on prevalent diabetes at enrolment, compared with women without diabetes, women with self-reported diabetes, and the subset of women with treated diabetes, had significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer without adjusting for BMI (HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.13-1.85 for diabetes, HR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.19-2.07 for treated diabetes). However after adjusting for BMI, the associations between diabetes, diabetes treatment, diabetes duration and the risk of endometrial cancer became non-significant. Elevated risk was noted when considering combining diabetes diagnosed at baseline and during follow-up as time-dependent exposure (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.08-1.59) even after adjusting for BMI. No significant association was observed between metformin use and endometrial cancer risk. Our results suggest that the relationship observed in previous research between diabetes and endometrial cancer incidence may be largely confounded by body weight, although some modest independent elevated risk remains.",

      "abstract": "Aging can increase cancer incidence because of accumulated mutations that initiate cancer and via compromised body control of premalignant lesions development into cancer. Relative contributions of these two factors are debated. Recent evidence suggests that the latter is rate limiting. In particular, hyperglycemia caused by compromised body control of blood glucose may be a factor of selection of somatic mutation-bearing cells for the ability to use glucose for proliferation. High glucose utilization in aerobic glycolysis is a long known characteristic of cancer. The new evidence adds to the concepts that have been being developed starting from mid-1970ies to suggest that age-related shifts in glucose and lipid metabolism increase the risk of cancer and compromise prognoses for cancer patients and to propose antidiabetic biguanides, including metformin, for cancer prevention and as an adjuvant means of cancer treatment aimed at the metabolic rehabilitation of patients. The new evidence is consistent with several effects of glucose contributing to aging and acting synergistically to enhance carcinogenesis. Glucose can affect (i) separate cells (via promoting somatic mutagenesis and epigenetic instability), (ii) cell populations (via being a factor of selection of phenotypic variants in cell populations for higher glucose consumption and, ultimately, for high aerobic glycolysis); (iii) cell microenvironment (via modification of extracellular matrix proteins), and (iv) the systemic levels (via shifting the endocrine regulation of metabolism toward increasing blood lipids and body fat, which compromise immunological surveillance and promote inflammation). Thus, maintenance of youthful metabolic characteristics must be important for cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSCs) formation are two fundamental and well-studied processes contributing to cancer metastasis and tumor relapse. Cells can undergo a partial EMT to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype or a complete EMT to attain a mesenchymal one. Similarly, cells can reversibly gain or lose 'stemness'. This plasticity in cell states is modulated by signaling pathways such as Notch. However, the interconnections among the cell states enabled by EMT, CSCs and Notch signaling remain elusive. Here, we devise a computational model to investigate the coupling among the core decision-making circuits for EMT, CSCs and Notch. Our model predicts that hybrid E/M cells are most likely to associate with stem-like traits and enhanced Notch-Jagged signaling - a pathway implicated in therapeutic resistance. Further, we show that the position of the 'stemness window' on the 'EMT axis' is varied by altering the coupling strength between EMT and CSC circuits, and/or modulating Notch signaling. Finally, we analyze the gene expression profile of CSCs from several cancer types and observe a heterogeneous distribution along the 'EMT axis', suggesting that different subsets of CSCs may exist with varying phenotypes along the epithelial-mesenchymal axis. We further investigate therapeutic perturbations such as treatment with metformin, a drug associated with decreased cancer incidence and increased lifespan of patients. Our mechanism-based model explains how metformin can both inhibit EMT and blunt the aggressive potential of CSCs simultaneously, by driving the cells out of a hybrid E/M stem-like state with enhanced Notch-Jagged signaling.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer effects of aspirin, metformin, and statins against gastric cancer, one of the most common cancers in the world, have been reported. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate independent associations of aspirin, metformin, and statin use with gastric cancer incidence and mortality after adjustment for concomitant use of other drugs, using pooled cohort data extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance claim database. Follow-up started on January 1, 2004 and ended at the date of gastric cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2013. Exposures to drugs were defined as cumulative duration of use for aspirin and cumulative defined daily dose for metformin and statin, and were entered as time-dependent variables in Cox analysis models to avoid immortal time bias. Use of aspirin for longer than 182.5 and 547.5 days during 2-year interval was associated with reduced risks of gastric cancer incidence and mortality, respectively. Patients with diabetes were at higher risk of gastric cancer incidence and mortality than nondiabetic people, regardless of metformin treatment. However, metformin use among patients with diabetes was associated with a reduction in gastric cancer mortality in a dose-response manner. Statin use was also associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in the general population, but not with gastric cancer incidence. In conclusion, long-term use of aspirin was independently associated with reduced incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in the general population, but metformin or statin use was only associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in patients with diabetes and in the general population, respectively. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Long-term use of aspirin was independently associated with reduced incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in the general population. Metformin or statin use, however, was only associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in diabetic patients and in the general population in a dose-response manner, respectively.",

      "abstract": "A large prospective study in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the German D2C cohort, is presently being enumerated to investigate risk factors of incident cancer in diabetic patients. A disease management program was offered, on a voluntary basis, to all T2D patients who were members of a statutory health insurance fund in Germany. This first feasibility report uses data from 26.742 T2D patients, who were 40 to 79 years old, resided in the Muenster District, and who were enrolled between June 2003 and July 2008. Cancer cases were identified through the regional Cancer Registry. Invasive cancer cases were identified using probabilistic record linkage procedures and pseudonymised personal identifiers. Censoring date was December 31, 2008. We included only first cancers, leaving 12.650 male and 14.092 female T2D with a total of 88.778 person-years (py). We computed standardised incidence ratios (SIR) for external comparisons and we employed Cox regression models and hazard ratios (HR) within the cohort. We identified 759 first cancers among male T2D patients (18.7 per 1,000 py) and 605 among females (12.7 per 1,000 py). The risk of any incident cancer in T2D was raised (SIR = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [1.10 - 1.21]), in particular for cancer of the liver (SIR = 1.94 [1.15 - 2.94]) and pancreas (SIR = 1.45 [1.07-1.92]). SIRs decreased markedly with time after T2D diagnosis. In Cox models, adjusting for diabetes duration, body mass index and sex, insulin therapy was related to higher cancer risk (HR = 1.25 [1.17 - 1.33]). No effect was seen for metformin. Our study demonstrates feasibility of record linkage between DMP and cancer registries. These first cohort results confirm previous reports. It is envisaged to enhance this cohort by inclusion of further regions of the state, expansion of the follow-up times, and collection of a more detailed medication history.",

      "abstract": "Racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer is under studied in men with diabetes who are at a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer. This study assessed the race/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer incidence for men with type II diabetes (T2D) and whether the impact of metformin on prostate cancer incidence varied by race/ethnicity. We conducted a retrospective study in 76,733 male veterans with T2D during 2003 to 2012. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for covariates and propensity scores of metformin use and race/ethnic group membership was utilized to compute the HR of prostate cancer incidence associated with race/ethnicity and compare HR associated with metformin use between race/ethnic groups. Mean follow-up was 6.4 ± 2.8 years; 7% were Hispanics; 17% were African Americans (AA); mean age was 67.8 ± 9.8 years; 5.2% developed prostate cancer; and 38.9% used metformin. Among these diabetic men without metformin use, prostate cancer incidence was higher in Hispanics and AA than in non-Hispanic White (NHW). Use of metformin alone or metformin + statins was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics compared with NHW, but not between AA and NHW. Use of metformin + finasteride was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics and AA compared with NHW. Our results suggested that metformin treatment could be a potential strategy to reduce prostate cancer incidence in the minority populations who are at high risk for fatal prostate cancer. It will be important to further examine the pleiotropic effects of metformin in multi-race/ethnic prospective studies to better inform clinical management and potentially reduce racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer incidence among diabetic men.

Regular users of analgesics included those using prescription analgesics ≥ 15 days per month at least 6 times over 2 years after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (baseline). The effectiveness of analgesics in patients with diabetes was evaluated using metformin adherence and three models: model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), exercise, cholesterol, hypertension, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI); and model 3 was further adjusted for analgesics. Based on stringent extraction criteria, the sample had a cancer incidence of 4.6%. The hazard ratios of models 1 and 2 were 0.830 and 0.865, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for all variables, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, was 0.871 (model 3). Regular use of analgesics by patients with diabetes decreased their risk of subsequent cancer development in this large national cohort. Compared with participants who did not develop cancer, those with cancer were older and more likely to be male, did not exercise, have more comorbidities (as assessed by CCI), and did not use analgesics regularly.",

The National Health Insurance reimbursement database of Taiwanese male patients with new-onset T2DM between 1998 and 2002 and aged ⩾40years (n=395,481) were retrieved to follow up prostate cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Metformin was treated as a time-dependent variable. Of the patients studied, 209,269 were never-users and 186,212 were ever-users. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate prostate cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios using Cox regression for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in various subgroups, using time-dependent and non-time-dependent approaches. During the follow-up, 2776 metformin ever-users and 9642 never-users developed prostate cancer, representing an incidence of 239.42 and 737.10 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) after adjustment for propensity score (PS) for ever- versus never-users was 0.467 (0.446-0.488). The PS-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 0.741 (0.698-0.786), 0.474 (0.441-0.508) and 0.231 (0.212-0.253), respectively (P-trend<0.001); and were 0.742 (0.700-0.786), 0.436 (0.406-0.468) and 0.228 (0.208-0.251) for the respective cumulative dose (P-trend<0.001). Sensitivity analyses consistently supported a protective effect of metformin on incident prostate cancer. Metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of incident prostate cancer in Taiwanese male patients with T2DM.",

A retrospective cohort of 92,366 women with newly diagnosed T2D was obtained from a diabetes register (FinDM). 590 endometrioid ECs were observed during the follow-up time. Poisson regression was utilized to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the endometrioid EC in relation to the use of metformin, other oral ADM, insulin and statins. Nested case-control analyses were performed, where up to 20 controls were matched for age and duration of DM for each EC case. The HRs were estimated by conditional logistic regression for never/ever and cumulative use of different forms of ADM and statins. In the case-control analyses the use of metformin (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51) and other oral ADM (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.50) was associated with an increased incidence of endometrioid EC compared to no ADM use. No difference was observed between metformin users and those using other oral ADMs. The use of statins was inversely related to the incidence of endometrioid EC (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94). Results from the full cohort analysis supported this finding. In our study the use of metformin or other oral forms of ADM was not associated with a lowered risk of endometrioid EC in women with T2D. Instead statins were observed to be inversely associated with endometrioid EC in this population.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer incidence and mortality vary dramatically by geographical location. Both are higher in developed countries. Some attribute this to westernized lifestyles of high-energy diets and limited physical activity with consequent obesity. Obesity and obesity-related diseases like diabetes cause hyperinsulinaemia, which upregulates pro-survival cell signalling. Previous work revealed diet-induced hyperinsulinaemia enhances prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Metformin, an antidiabetic medication, reduces hyperinsulinaemia and also exhibits antineoplastic properties. Herein, we assess the potential additive benefit of combining bicalutamide antiandrogen therapy with metformin, in vitro and in vivo. Using clonogenic assays, we assessed the effect of bicalutamide and/or metformin on clonogenicity in prostate cancer cell lines. Western blot and cell cycle analyses were used to elucidate mechanisms of interaction between the drugs in androgen receptor (AR)-positive (LNCaP) and AR-negative (PC3) cell lines. The combination treatment regimen was assessed in vivo using an LNCaP murine xenograft model. Micromolar bicalutamide or millimolar metformin caused a significant dose-dependent reduction in clonogenicity (P<0.001). Combination treatment further significantly reduced clonogenicity (P<0.005) with greater effects in AR-positive cells. Western blot and cell cycle analyses suggested differing mechanisms of interaction in AR-positive and -negative cell lines. Following combination treatment, LNCaP cells exhibited an altered cell proliferation (decreased phospho mammalian target of rapamycin expression) and perturbed cell cycle kinetics (G1/S cell cycle arrest). PC3 cells showed evidence of enhanced apoptosis (increased Bcl-2-associated X protein and decreased total caspase 3 expression). Markedly diminished tumour growth occurred following combination treatment in vivo (P<0.001). Combining bicalutamide and metformin significantly reduces prostate cancer cell growth further than either monotherapy. In AR-positive cells, this effect appeared to be mediated by reducing proliferation rates, whereas in AR-negative cells the combination treatment appeared to promote apoptosis. This combination drug regimen may improve prostate-cancer-specific survival by the direct antineoplastic properties outlined.",

This study examines the effect of more vs less intensive glucose control on the risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. All 11,140 participants from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00145925) were studied. Cancer incidence and cancer mortality was compared in groups randomised to intensive or standard glucose control. Information on events during follow-up was obtained from serious adverse event reports and death certificates. HRs (95% CI) were calculated for all cancers, all solid cancers, cancer deaths and site-specific cancers. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 363 and 337 cancer events were reported in the intensive and standard control groups, respectively (incidence 1.39/100 person-years [PY] and 1.28/100 PY; HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.93-1.26]). The incidences of all solid cancers and cancer deaths were 1.25/100 PY and 0.55/100 PY in the intensive group and 1.15/100 PY and 0.63/100 PY in the standard group (HR 1.09[95% CI 0.93–1.27] for solid cancers, and 0.88 [0.71–1.10] for cancer death) [corrected].Across all the major organ systems studied, no significant differences in the cancer incidences were observed in the intensive and standard control groups. More intensive glucose control achieved with a regimen that included greater use of gliclazide, insulin, metformin and other agents, did not affect the risk of cancer events or death in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Observational studies have associated metformin use with a decreased risk of lung cancer incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the studies had important methodological shortcomings. The objective of this study was to determine whether metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes, while avoiding previous biases. Using the U.K. General Practice Research Database, we assembled a cohort of patients newly treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) between 1988 and 2009. A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where case subjects with lung cancer occurring during follow-up were matched with up to 10 control subjects for age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of lung cancer associated with ever use of metformin, along with measures of duration and cumulative dose. Models were adjusted for potential confounders, which included smoking. The cohort included 115,923 new users of OHAs, with 1,061 patients diagnosed with lung cancer during follow-up (rate 2.0/1,000 person-years). Metformin use was not associated with a decreased rate of lung cancer (rate ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.76-1.17]). No dose-response was observed by number of prescriptions received, cumulative duration of use, and dose. Metformin use is not associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. The decreased risk reported in other observational studies is likely due to bias from methodological shortcomings. Nonetheless, greater consideration should be given to clarify inconsistencies between experimental models and population studies.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a well-tolerated drug frequently prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes. Extended metformin use has been linked to a significant decrease in cancer incidence across both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Here we investigate the anti-proliferative effects of metformin on fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. Our findings demonstrate that metformin's inhibitory impact on cell proliferation is effective in the absence of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Using an unbiased genetic screen we identified the plasma membrane signalling scaffold Efr3, critical for phosphatidylinositol signalling and the generation of PI4Ps, as a key determinant of resistance to the anti-proliferative effect of metformin. Deletion of <i>efr3</i> resulted in both AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent resistance to metformin. We show that Efr3 does not influence cell proliferation by controlling Ras1 activity or its cellular localization in yeast. We observe that <i>dnm1</i> (DRP1) mutants with elongated mitochondria are also resistant to the anti-proliferative effect of metformin and that metformin treatment promotes mitochondrial fusion. Metabolic measurements after prolonged metformin exposure demonstrated a reduction in respiration in both wild type and the <i>efr3</i> deletion, however, that reduction is less pronounced in the <i>efr3</i> deletion, which also contained elongated mitochondria. It is likely that mitochondrial fusion enhances yeast fitness in response to metformin exposure. Together we provide a new perspective on the cellular response to metformin.",

The world's first PARP inhibitor olaparib is mainly used for the treatment of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated tumors. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, has been reported to reduce cancer incidence in humans and improve survival in cancer patients. Cell viability and proliferation were detected by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay; cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry; cell migration and invasion abilities were detected by scratch assay and Transwell assay; STAT3/C-MYC signaling pathway protein were detected by western blotting. Olaparib combined with metformin has better effects on the proliferation, clone formation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells than single drug, indicating that metformin can enhance the inhibitory effect of olaparib on tumor growth and regulate the expression of STAT3/C-MYC signaling pathway proteins. The results of this study showed that metformin could significantly enhance the antitumor effect of olaparib on bladder cancer cells, and these effects were mediated by downregulating STAT3/C-MYC signaling pathway proteins. This finding may have potential clinical application in the treatment of bladder cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between use of metformin and risk of cancer in Koreans. This study was designed retrospectively using the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort conducted between 2002 and 2015. 40 to 69-year-old subjects who received a health screening examination from 2002 to 2003 were enrolled. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer were estimated in a multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis.

The median follow-up period was 12.7 years. Cumulative incidence of overall cancer was 7.9% (7.7, 10.3, and 11.1% in No DM, metformin users and non-users, respectively). Compared to metformin non-users, the fully adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of metformin users and No DM for overall cancer incidence were 0.73 (0.66-0.81) and 0.75 (0.64-0.88), respectively, in men and 0.83 (0.78-0.89) and 0.81 (0.72-0.92) in women. Diabetic patients receiving metformin treatment, and individuals without diabetes were at lower risk for cancer incidence than diabetic patients without metformin treatment.",

This study included a total of 732,199 participants who underwent a national health check-up from 2002 to 2003. Lung cancer incidence and mortality were identified using a registered lung cancer diagnosis code (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, code C34) and the Korean National Death Registry. The study participants were followed up from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. Medication exposure was defined by the cumulative duration of use and cumulative defined daily dose per 2-year interval. To avoid immortal-time bias, drug exposure was inserted as a time-dependent variable in Cox analysis, which evaluated the associations of these medications with lung cancer. Metformin use had a protective association with lung cancer incidence (p's for trend 0.008) and mortality (p's for trend < 0.001) in a dose-response fashion, and these associations were prominent among participants with a metformin cumulative defined daily dose of 547.5 and above compared with patients without diabetes. Lung cancer mortality was dose-dependently reduced with the use of aspirin (p's for trends 0.046) and statin (p's for trends < 0.001). The combined use of aspirin, statins, and metformin exhibited more prominent protective associations with lung cancer risk and mortality. The use of aspirin, metformin, and statins had independent protective associations with lung cancer mortality, and metformin had an inverse association with lung cancer risk. Further studies are necessary to develop clinically applicable anticancer strategies using these drugs for the reduction of lung cancer and related mortality.",

Metformin use is associated with decreased breast cancer incidence and currently evaluated in cancer clinical trials. The combined treatment with metformin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in vitro induces detachment of viable MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that retain their proliferation capacity. This might be important for cell detachment from primary tumors, but the metabolic changes involved are unknown. We performed LC/MS metabolic profiling on separated attached and detached MDA-MB-231 cells treated with metformin and/or 2DG. High 2DG and metformin plus 2DG altered the metabolic profile similarly to metformin, inferring that metabolic changes are necessary but not sufficient while the specific effects of 2DG are crucial for detachment. Detached cells had higher NADPH levels and lower fatty acids and glutamine levels compared to attached cells, supporting the role of AMPK activation and reductive carboxylation in supporting anchorage-independent survival. Surprisingly, the metabolic profile of detached cells was closer to untreated control cells than attached treated cells, suggesting detachment might help cells adapt to energy stress. Metformin treated cells had higher fatty and amino acid levels with lower purine nucleotide levels, which is relevant for understanding the anticancer mechanisms of metformin.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a major health concern for breast cancer survivors, being associated with high recurrence and reduced efficacy during cancer treatment. Metformin treatment is associated with reduced breast cancer incidence, recurrence and mortality. To better understand the underlying mechanisms through which metformin may reduce recurrence, we aimed to conduct metabolic profiling of overweight/obese breast cancer survivors before and after metformin treatment. Fasting plasma samples from 373 overweight or obese breast cancer survivors randomly assigned to metformin (n = 194) or placebo (n = 179) administration were collected at baseline, after 6 months (Reach For Health trial), and after 12 months (MetBreCS trial). Archival samples were concurrently analyzed using three complementary methods: untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolomics, targeted LC-MS metabolomics (AbsoluteIDQ p180, Biocrates), and gas chromatography phospholipid fatty acid assay. Multivariable linear regression models and family-wise error correction were used to identify metabolites that significantly changed after metformin treatment. Participants (n = 352) with both baseline and study end point samples available were included in the analysis. After adjusting for confounders such as study center, age, body mass index and false discovery rate, we found that metformin treatment was significantly associated with decreased levels of citrulline, arginine, tyrosine, caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline, and increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, proline, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate, alanine and indoxyl-sulphate. Long-chain unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC ae C36:4, PC ae C38:5, PC ae C36:5 and PC ae C38:6) were significantly decreased with the metformin treatment, as were phospholipid-derived long-chain n-6 fatty acids. The metabolomic profiles of metformin treatment suggest change in specific biochemical pathways known to impair cancer cell growth including activation of CYP1A2, alterations in fatty acid desaturase activity, and altered metabolism of specific amino acids, including impaired branched chain amino acid catabolism. Our results in overweight breast cancer survivors identify new metabolic effects of metformin treatment that may mechanistically contribute to reduced risk of recurrence in this population and reduced obesity-related cancer risk reported in observational studies.

The association between cancer incidence and the use of antidiabetic medications in patients with T2DM has been recently examined. There have been conflicting reports regarding an association between metformin and cancer risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between metformin use and the incidence of cancer in Koreans with T2DM.Data from The Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP, 2006-2014), a nationwide, large-scale, prospective, multicenter cohort study in Korea, were used to study patients with T2DM. Patients ≥30 years old whose complete medical records were available were included in this study. Patients with a history of any cancer on KNDP registration or those who had been diagnosed with any type of cancer within 1 year of metformin use were excluded. Survival curves with respect to the incidence of cancer were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.During a mean 5.8 years of follow-up, 164 of the 1918 study patients (335 metformin nonusers and 1583 metformin users) developed cancer. The incidence per 1000 person-years was 21.8 in metformin nonusers and 13.2 in metformin users. Metformin users had a reduced risk of cancer, even after adjustment for demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters, diabetic complications, and other antidiabetic medications (hazard ratio 0.513, 95% confidence interval 0.318-0.826, P = .0060). Subgroup analysis of metformin users showed a reduced risk of cancer in males, patients < 65 years of age, patients with a T2DM duration < 5 years, nonobese patients, nonsmokers, and good glycemic control group.This large-scale, prospective, multicenter cohort study demonstrated an association between metformin use and reduced cancer risk in patients with T2DM.",

This retrospective study investigated the association between metformin use and stomach cancer incidence in a Korean population using the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort database. Participants aged 40-80 years old at the baseline period (2002-2003) were enrolled. The study population was categorized into three groups of metformin non-users with DM, metformin users with DM, and individuals without DM (No DM group). A total of 347,895 participants (14,922 metformin non-users, 9891 metformin users, and 323,082 individuals without DM) were included in the final analysis. The median follow-up duration was 12.70 years. The estimated cumulative incidence of stomach cancer was highest in metformin non-users and lowest in the No DM group (men vs. women: 3.75 vs. 1.97% in metformin non-users, 2.91 vs. 1.53% in metformin users, and 2.54 vs. 0.95% in the No DM group). Compared with metformin non-users, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stomach cancer incidence of metformin users and the No DM group were 0.710 (0.579-0.870) and 0.879 (0.767-1.006) in men and 0.700 (0.499-0.981) and 0.701 (0.544-0.903) in women, respectively, after full adjustment. Metformin users with DM in the Korean population were at lower risk of stomach cancer incidence after controlling for potential confounding factors.",

This study investigated the association between metformin use and thyroid cancer risk in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The reimbursement databases of all diabetic patients from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2006 and 1,414,723 patients with type 2 diabetes were followed for thyroid cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of metformin exposure using tertile cutoffs for cumulative duration of therapy and cumulative dose were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted. There were 795,321 ever-users and 619,402 never-users, with respective numbers of incident thyroid cancer of 683 (0.09%) and 1,614 (0.26%), and respective incidence of 24.09 and 87.33 per 100,000 person-years. The overall fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.683 (0.598-0.780), and all categories of the dose-response parameters showed significantly lower risk with P-trends < 0.0001. The protective effect of metformin on thyroid cancer incidence was also supported by sensitivity analyses, disregarding age (< 50 or ≥ 50 years) and sex; and was not affected by excluding users of insulin, sulfonylurea, and insulin and/or sulfonylurea respectively, by previous diagnosis of other cancers or by potential detection examinations that might lead to differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer. This study provides evidence for the first time that metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes may reduce the risk of thyroid cancer.",

      "abstract": "Population studies have suggested that metformin use in diabetic patients decreases cancer incidence and mortality. Metformin inhibits the growth of cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo. However, there is little clinical data to support this. Our purpose was to determine whether metformin use was associated with a change in pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We identified 2,529 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer between 1990 and 2007. Patients were compared by groups: 68 diabetic patients taking metformin, 87 diabetic patients not taking metformin, and 2,374 nondiabetic patients. pCR rates were compared between the three groups using chi(2) tests of independence and compared pair- wise using a binomial test of proportions. Factors predictive of pCR were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. The rate of pCR was 24% in the metformin group, 8.0% in the nonmetformin group, and 16% in the nondiabetic group (P = .02). Pairwise comparisons between the metformin and nonmetformin groups (P = .007) and the nonmetformin and nondiabetic groups (P = .04) were significant. Comparison of the pCR rates between the metformin and nondiabetic groups trended toward but did not meet significance (P = .10). Metformin use was independently predictive of pCR (odds ratio, 2.95; P = .04) after adjustment for diabetes, body mass index, age, stage, grade, receptor status, and neoadjuvant taxane use. Diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving metformin and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a higher pCR rate than do diabetics not receiving metformin. Additional studies to evaluate the potential of metformin as an antitumor agent are warranted.",

Metformin, a caloric restriction mimetic, has a long history of safe use as an insulin sensitizer in diabetics and has been shown to reduce cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality in humans. To determine the potential impact of dietary energy availability and metformin therapy on aggressive breast tumor growth and metastasis, an orthotopic syngeneic model using triple negative 66cl4 tumor cells in Balb/c mice was employed. The effect of dietary restriction, a standard maintenance diet or a diet with high levels of free sugar, were tested for their effects on tumor growth and secondary metastases to the lung. Metformin therapy with the various diets indicated that metformin can be highly effective at suppressing systemic metabolic biomarkers such as IGF-1, insulin and glucose, especially in the high energy diet treated animals. Long-term metformin treatment demonstrated moderate yet significant effects on primary tumor growth, most significantly in conjunction with the high energy diet. When compared to the control diet, the high energy diet promoted tumor growth, expression of the inflammatory adipokines leptin and resistin, induced lung priming by bone marrow-derived myeloid cells and promoted metastatic potential. Metformin had no effect on adipokine expression or the development of lung metastases with the standard or the high energy diet. These data indicate that metformin may have tumor suppressing activity where a metabolic phenotype of high fuel intake, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes exist, but may have little or no effect on events controlling the metastatic niche driven by proinflammatory events.",

Several retrospective studies suggested a decrease in Prostate Cancer incidence and mortality with metformin (MET). MET has also demonstrated anti-tumor activity in Prostate Cancer preclinical models, with increased apoptosis when added to DOCE. We aimed at exploring the role of MET in combination with DOCE in mCRPC. Non-diabetic mCRPC patients were randomly assigned to receive DOCE 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 21 days + prednisone (5 mg.

Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity and quality of life (QoL). Out of 99 patients were randomized (D+M = 50; D+P = 49) in 10 French centers. The median follow-up was 86 (IQR 73-88) months. The PSA-response rate reached 66% in the D+M arm, but was not different from that observed in the D+P arm (63%, P = 0,94). In the D+M and D+P arms, the ORR was 28% and 24%, the median PFS was 7.8 and 6.0 months and the median OS was 27 and 20 months (ns), respectively. Diarrhea grade I to II was more frequent in the MET arm (66% vs. 43%). No impairment of QoL was observed. MET addition failed to improve the standard DOCE regimen in mCRPC. Further research targeting tumor cell metabolism should be performed.",

      "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that incidence of and mortality from several malignancies are increased among diabetic patients. Whether certain treatment modalities, including use of metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulins, affect cancer incidence or mortality and whether use of long-acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir may increase cancer incidence more than traditional human insulins are debated. The objective was to investigate the association between specific glucose-lowering agents and cancer incidence in diabetic members of an Israeli health maintenance organization. We studied a cohort of 36,342 diabetic patients aged at least 18 years with no history of cancer or treatment with insulin as of January 1, 2003. For the period from January 2003 to December 2007, we searched pharmacy records for purchases of glucose-lowering agents, including metformin, sulfonylureas, human insulin, and analogue insulins. Incident cancer diagnoses were identified from the health maintenance organization cancer registry. We studied the association of cancer incidence with the use of specific glucose-lowering agents, controlling for age, sex, and baseline glycohemoglobin measurement. Cancer was diagnosed in 6% of the study cohort during 164,652 person-years of follow-up time. Cancer incidence increased with age and varied with medication purchasing patterns. On multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.049; confidence interval [CI], 1.045-1.052), male sex (HR, 1.16; CI, 1.065-1.264), and number of insulin purchases (HR, 1.007; CI, 1.001-1.012) were significantly associated with increased cancer risk, whereas number of metformin purchases was associated with reduced cancer risk (HR, 0.996; CI, 0.994-0.998). Male sex, age, and human insulin purchases were associated with increased cancer incidence, whereas metformin purchases were associated with decreased cancer risk. There was a trend for increased cancer incidence associated with use of long-acting insulin analogues, but the number of long-acting insulin analogue users was too small for risk estimates to be conclusive.",

The present study is aimed at assessing the long-term association of different insulin analogues with cancer incidence. A nested case-control study dataset was generated from the cohort study dataset (n = 1,340 insulin-treated diabetic outpatients) by sampling control subjects from the risk sets. For each case subject, the control subjects (up to five) were chosen randomly from those members of the cohort who are at risk for the same follow-up time of the case subject. Five-year age classes, sex, and BMI classes (<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, and >or=30 kg/m(2)) were considered as additional categorical matching variables. During a median follow-up of 75.9 months (interquartile range 27.4-133.7), 112 case subjects of incident cancer were compared with 370 matched control subjects. A significantly higher mean daily dose of glargine was observed in case subjects than in control subjects (0.24 IU/kg/day [0.10-0.39] versus 0.16 IU/kg/day [0.12-0.24], P = 0.036). Incident cancer was associated with a dose of glargine >or=0.3 IU/kg/day even after adjusting for Charlson comorbidity score, other types of insulin administration, and metformin exposure (odds ratio 5.43 [95% CI 2.18-13.53], P < 0.001). No association between incident cancer and insulin doses was found for human insulin or other analogues. The possibility of association between cancer and higher glargine doses suggests that dosages should always be considered when assessing the possible association of insulin and its analogues with cancer.",

We studied the activity of metformin against diverse molecular subtypes of breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Metformin showed biological activity against all estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative, erbB2 normal and abnormal breast cancer cell lines tested. It inhibited cellular proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused partial cell cycle arrest at the G(1) checkpoint. Metformin did not induce apoptosis (as measured by DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage) in luminal A, B or erbB2 subtype breast cancer cell lines. At the molecular level, metformin treatment was associated with a reduction of cyclin D1 and E2F1 expression with no changes in p27(kip1) or p21(waf1). It inhibited mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt activity, as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in both ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells. In erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, metformin reduced erbB2 expression at higher concentrations, and at lower concentrations within the therapeutic range, it inhibited erbB2 tyrosine kinase activity evidenced by a reduction of phosphorylated erbB2 (P-erbB2) at both auto- and Src- phosphorylation sites. These data suggest that metformin may have potential therapeutic utility against ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "To address the possible association between the use of metformin, other forms of antidiabetic medication (ADM) and statins with the incidence of breast cancer in women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Data were collected from a Finnish nationwide diabetes database (FinDM). The study cohort consisted of women diagnosed with T2D in 1996-2011 in Finland. In full-cohort analysis, Poisson regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) in relation to use of metformin, insulin, other forms of oral ADM and statins. In nested case-control analysis, up to 20 controls were matched for age and duration of diabetes to each case of breast cancer. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate HRs in relation to medication use and cumulative use of different forms of ADM, and statins. 2300 women were diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up. No difference in breast cancer incidence was observed between metformin users [HR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.11] or statin users (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.05) compared with non-users. In nested case-control analysis the results were similar. Use of insulin (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.36) was associated with a slightly increased incidence of breast cancer. No evidence of an association between the use of metformin or statins and the incidence of breast cancer in women with T2D was found. Among insulin users, a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer was observed.",

NPC has a high recurrence risk after initial treatment due to its high metastatic and immune escape potential. One study has found that metformin can improve cancer outcomes and reduce cancer incidence. With antitumor activity, metformin can have low toxicity when used in combination with some common chemotherapy drugs. This study was designed to explore the effects of cisplatin combined with metformin on the proliferation and apoptosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. An appropriate cisplatin concentration was selected for NPC cells, and the cells were treated with metformin at a gradient concentration, and then, some of them were treated with cisplatin. Subsequently, the biological effects (activity, migration, invasion, and apoptosis) of metformin alone and metformin combined with cisplatin on NPC cells were evaluated. Metformin alone inhibited cell activity, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, while compared with cisplatin alone, cisplatin combined with metformin had stronger inhibition on cell activity, migration, and invasion and stronger induction to cell apoptosis, and a higher concentration of them demonstrated stronger effects. Cisplatin combined with metformin can strongly inhibit the activity of NPC cells and promote their apoptosis.",

Cancer prevention should be actively proposed even to healthy individuals, and not just to individuals with high cancer risk. We discuss evaluation of a high cancer risk versus the relatively low risk for side effects of chemopreventive agents. The concept of cancer interception, which is halting transformed cells from becoming malignant cancers, should be adopted for cancer prevention. Potential prevention/interception actions include adopting healthy life style and avoiding carcinogens, repressing inflammation and pathologic angiogenesis, controlling metabolism, correcting insulin resistance and other metabolic alterations. Current drugs with limited toxicity can be repurposed to reduce cancer incidence. Aspirin is now being recommended for the prevention of colorectal cancer and it prevents other neoplasms as well. Metformin and β-blockers could be valuable for reducing pancreatic and breast cancer onset. On the basis of the evaluation of cancer risk, we here call for personalized approaches for cancer prevention and preventive interception and we envisage a list of measures and potential guidelines for preventive and interceptive strategies to reduce cancer burden. Investment into translational research to bring these approaches into public health policies and in the clinic is urgently needed. Clin Cancer Res; 22(17); 4322-7. ©2016 AACR.",

      "abstract": "Cancer incidence continues to be a major health problem possibly because cancer is a complex system comprising many agents that interact in a non-linear manner resulting in many possible outcomes. The degree of complexity of a cancer system could be vast involving multiple endogenous and exogenous agents interacting with the over 10 trillion cells comprising the body. It is hypothesized that the practical management of this complexity may be a key to cancer prevention and possibly treatment. But the management and resolution of such an immensely complex system is difficult and may require a multidisciplinary approach including physics, biology, biochemistry and medical science. Research such as in systems biology involving large data sets may offer resolution in time, but the scale of the task is daunting. In evaluating the hypothesis, this paper proposes a method of resolution of the complex cancer system through a proxy in the form of the vital body system, energy balance, involved in several cancer processes. Although I suggest that the energy balance system is itself complex, it may permit access to factors that may be used in limiting cancer initiation. Meta-analysis related to factors of blood sugar, inflammation, stress and immune response reveal that they could be likely candidates for management. Analysis also reveals certain devices that may give practical effect to these management options. Due to the inherent complexity of a cancer system, multiple devices may need to be applied in a combination. The analysis suggests that the low-risk and low-cost devices metformin, vitamin D and vitamin C, may prove to be suitable for use as a practical cancer prevention strategy. If the presented hypothesis is correct, a practical method for prevention or management of cancer may be possible. A trial to test the hypothesis is proposed.",

      "abstract": "Deciphering the mutational pattern of skin tumours, remains a major challenge for clinicians and researchers. Over 80% of mutations in tumours are acquired, which in practice also means preventable. The surgical treatment of skin cancer and cancer in general is a worldwide, unsolved but at the same time not unsolvable problem. The problem concerning the dilemma of acquired mutations lies in the circumstance of their being allowed and subsequently treated. A more logical solution would be to eliminate the problem by making contact with mutagens in drugs public, clarifying it, studying it in detail and definitively stopping it. At present, there is an alarming and unexplained tendency worldwide : 1) Potential acquired mutations, caused in all probability by contact with known exogenous mutagens- the nitrosamines in most commonly prescribed drugs, are allowed to occur. 2) And subsequently, the diseases generated by them- treated (at a later stage) by multiple surgical interventions and unjustifiably expensive targeted therapy; 3) Mutagens - such as nitrosamines for example, to be in a permissive or possibly permissive availability regime. Moreover, this permissible availability turns out to be ubiquitous and affects the most common medicines worldwide: metformin, ranitidine, propranolol, rifampicin, irbesartan, olmesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, eprosartan, losartan, ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, etc. In certain geographical regions, there is almost no patient taking this type of medication who has not had at least one tumour detected. These significant correlations (nitrosamines/cancer) are labeled by the regulatory institutions as possible, probable, or not currently relevant. But in spite of ˝this inconclusiveness˝, the drugs, containing nitrosamines, are withdrawn from the pharmaceutical market: quickly and quietly, despite the fact that ˝they did not pose a threat˝. The FDA was the only organization and the most important regulatory body worldwide, which lifted the veil from this ominous picture back in 2018: nitrosamines in blood medicines and cancer risk. Unfortunately, at the moment, the problems with this issue are proving to be more than the solutions, and at the same time it remains completely unclear who is to blame for this 'sporadic contamination': the packaging of the drug, the humidity in the rooms where the preparations are stored or the synthesis process itself - the explanations are divergent, the responsibility is blurred. This fuzzy liability does not affect the manufacturers and distributors of the preparations/nitrosamines themselves in the manner required by law for this (mis)act. The Bulgarian Society of Dermatological Surgery remains to be the only organization worldwide that for the 5th consecutive year continues to seek solutions to the above-mentioned problems by: 1) Officialising all cases of skin tumors (but not only) occurring after intake of nitrosamine-contaminated drugs, 2) also officialising a significant number of cases of patients with cutaneous melanomas treated by the one-stage surgical removal method within one surgical session (OSMS). The main priorities of the organization remain: 1) the complete elimination of nitrosamines from drugs worldwide, 2) the optimization of melanoma surgical treatment guidelines with the goal of treatment within 1 surgical session: for thin melanomas, dysplastic nevi and melanoma in situ, a surgical margin of safety of 1 cm in all directions and without detection and removal of the draining sentinel lymph node. Whereas for medium and thick melanomas, the focus should be directed to the following recommendation: 2 cm surgical margin of safety plus detection and removal of the draining lymph node within one surgical session. The indication for the surgical removal of these lesions should be made on the basis of radically different criteria from those used to date by the AJCC/EJC, namely: based on 1) clinical presentation/ clinical morphology, 2) dermatoscopic finding, and if there is a melanoma suspected lesion with possible tumour thickness greater than 1 mm , 3) ultrasonographic measurement for preoperative determination of tumor thickness should be additionally performed. The methodology is applicable in up to 80% of cases, excluding only some rare findings such as: amelanotic cutaneous melanomas, cutaneous melanomas with regression zones or those with localization in the neck and head. However, after careful individual assessment and a subsequent selected approach, even these exceptions could be included in the innovative algorithm for one step surgical removal of cutaneous melanomas. The resulting problems of not resolving these two dilemmas could lead to: 1) Generation of skin cancer (but not only), through the availability of nitrosamines in drugs. 2) Unnecessary and stressful /surgeries for the patients- 2 in number, which not infrequently lead to complication of their status (due to delay of histopathological analysis/ desire for second opinion/ delay regarding the timeframe for the second surgical intervention/ uncertainty regarding the resection lines within the first intervention/ failure to respect the recommended surgical security resection margins already within the first surgical session, etc.). 3) Huge additional costs to health care systems on the order of probably/roughly calculated about $50 billion per year. Resolution of these two dilemmas would likely result in a dramatic drop in cancer incidence worldwide and a significant improvement in the effectiveness/efficiency of surgical treatment for cutaneous melanoma.",

In this review, we discuss the impact of obesity and consequences of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, on breast cancer risk and recurrence. Recent work has identified multiple molecular mechanisms that may underlie the association between obesity and breast cancer. In particular, insulin resistance, increased inflammatory cytokines, leptin signaling, and adipokine signaling have been shown to affect breast cancer risk and outcomes. While obesity is associated with higher breast cancer incidences and worse breast cancer outcomes, several risk reduction methods have been shown to attenuate these risks. Both metformin and statins have been shown to improve disease free survival and overall survival compared to non-users. Metformin also has been associated with lower risk of breast cancer incidence. Furthermore, increased physical activity and weight loss have been shown to decrease risk of breast cancer, especially in post-menopausal women. These studies have emphasized the potential impact that lifestyle changes can have on breast cancer risk and outcomes, and demonstrate the need for randomized control trials to evaluate the roles of metformin and statins for the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer.",

We conducted a longitudinal observational cohort study using 3 population-based databases in Taiwan. Using propensity score matching, we compared patients with type 2 diabetes who enrolled in a P4P program with a similar group of patients who did not enroll in the in P4P program (non-P4P). Primary end points of interest were risks of incident cancer and all-cause, cancer-specific, and diabetes-related mortality. Total person-years and incidence and mortality rates per 1,000 person-years were calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and competing risk regression were used in the analysis. Overall, our findings indicated that the diabetes P4P program was not significantly associated with lower risks of cancer incidence, but it was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.63), cancer-specific mortality (aSHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-1.00), and diabetes-related mortality (aSHR, 0.54: 95% CI, 0.49-0.60). Metformin, thiazolidinediones, and α glucosidase inhibitors were associated with lower risks of cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality. Our findings provide evidence of the potential benefit of diabetes P4P programs in reducing risks of all-cause mortality and competing causes of death attributable to cancer-specific and diabetes-related mortality among type 2 diabetes patients.",

We have shown that CR initiated late in life begins to extend lifespan, reduce cancer as a cause of death, and reproduce approximately three-quarters of the genomic effects of LTCR in 8 wk (CR8). Eight weeks of metformin treatment was superior to CR8 at reproducing LTCR-like gene expression changes, maintaining a superior number of such changes over a broad range of statistical stringencies, and producing more Gene Ontology terms overlapping those produced by LTCR. Consistent with these results, metformin has been shown to reduce cancer incidence in mice and humans. Phenformin, a chemical cousin of metformin, extends lifespan and reduces tumor incidence in mice. Taken together, these results indicate that gene expression biomarkers can be used to identify promising candidate CR mimetics.",

      "abstract": "The Nitrosogenesis of skin cancer is a newly introduced concept in medical science, the significance of which is yet to be the subject of detailed analyses and discussions. Contamination of the most commonly used drugs for systemic treatment worldwide (such as Angiotensin receptor II blockers/ARBs, ACE inhibitors, Beta blockers, Thiazide diuretics, Metformin, Ranitidine, Nizatidine, tricyclic antidepressants, anticoagulants/dabigatran, Rifampicin, calcium channel blockers, SSRIs/ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Varenicline) is already a fact and is more than worrying but also indicative. It is \"this relationship\" that has been repeatedly described in the medical literature (initially) as an association, and subsequently now increasingly as a causal relationship, a pathogenetic relationship. Observational data from clinicians over the past year increasingly speak in favour of a pathogenetic link and associate every single drug declared as contaminated with the development of heterogeneous forms of skin cancer gradually and surely. New drugs are added monthly that have not yet been declared as actually/potentially contaminated but are probably known to regulatory authorities or are in the process of being clarified. In parallel, the number of nitrosamines identified as contaminants in medicines is growing. This should not be surprising to anyone: ˝You take 3 drugs contaminated with mutagens- you subsequently develop skin cancer˝. Polymorbidity and multimedication against the background of polycontamination with nitrosamines appears to be the most serious problem at present. While until recently polymorbidity was considered to be a key factor in carcinogenesis (generator, trigger, inducer), today this dogma should be re-examined or looked at from another, radically different angle: from the angle of polycontamination to multimedication within polymorbidity. It is this that could provide a good explanation for the pandemic concerning skin cancer, for example. The development of relatively identical patterns of manifestation of skin tumors after concomitant intake of drugs declared as contaminated (drugs from the classes already mentioned above/ with radically different mechanism of action) supports unequivocally the thesis that: the nitrosogenesis of skin cancer is an undeniable fact that should be studied in detail. Studied because it could be eliminated. The analysis presented within this scientific thesis concerns 4 polymorbid patients who developed skin tumors within the framework of the multimedication they were assigned. The concomitant intake of medications declared as contaminated (in the presented patients) led to the manifestation of single or multiple skin neoplasms that were successfully treated surgically. Once again, the importance of potential/actual contamination of beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antidiabetic drugs, and sartans in the generation of 1) non-melanocytic forms of skin cancer, and 2) melanoma precursor lesions or so-called dysplastic moles is established and validated. The possible contamination with nitrosamines of 1) other types of tricyclic antidepressant- Melitracen; 2) antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class: Paroxetine; 3) antidepressant of the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) class: Venlafaxine, as well as of the systemic anticoagulant: apixaban is highlighted for the first time in the world literature.",

Type 2 diabetes patients with first diagnoses of breast, prostate or digestive organ cancer were selected in general and internal medicine practices (Disease Analyzer Germany: 01/2008-12/2014). Propensity score matching between DPP-4i users and non-users was carried out for age, sex, diabetes duration, and metformin use. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for metastases further adjusting for HbA1c, body mass index, comorbidity and co-therapy with glucose-lowering drugs (3-4years follow-up). 668 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, 906 with prostate cancer and 908 with digestive organ cancer were analyzed. In Cox regression, use of DPP-4i was not associated with an increased risk of metastases in patients with breast (adjusted HR, 95%CI: 1.00, 0.49-2.02), prostate (0.98, 0.54-1.77) or digestive organ cancers (0.97, 0.57-1.66).

We identified a clinical cohort of male veterans in the United States who were ≥65years old with T2D and free from ARCs during 2002-2003.

The aim of this study is to study the change in mtDNA-CN in patients with PCOS who were treated with metformin. This is a prospective cohort of patients with PCOS, who received metformin for one year. From 2009 to 2015, 88 women diagnosed with PCOS, based on the Rotterdam criteria, were enrolled. Serial measurements of mtDNA-CN, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), anthropometric, metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory markers were obtained before and after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. A significant decrease in mtDNA-CN was seen over the course of one year. Other markers, including 8-OHdG, testosterone, free androgen index, blood pressure and liver enzymes, also decreased in the same interval. On regression analysis, there was a significant association between the change in mtDNA-CN and serum total testosterone, and no association between mtDNA-CN and metabolic factors. Treatment with metformin is associated with a time-dependent decrease in mtDNA-CN in patients with PCOS who are treated over the course of one year. This may signify a reduction in mitochondria dysfunction. The change in mtDNA-CN corresponds to a similar change in serum total testosterone, and suggests a possible relationship between mtDNA-CN and testosterone. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00172523 .

One hundred seventeen patients treated with TomoTherapy™ between 2008 and 2015 prospectively completed a side-effect questionnaire (VoxTox Trial Registration: UK CRN ID 13716). Baseline patient and treatment data were collected. Radiotherapy plans were analysed; mean and maximum spinal cord dose and volumes receiving 10, 20, 30 and 40 Gy were recorded. Dose variation across the cord was examined. These data were included in a logistic regression model. Forty two patients (35.9%) reported LS symptoms. Concurrent weekly cisplatin did not increase LS risk (p = 0.70, OR = 1.23 {95% CI 0.51-2.34}). Of 13 diabetic participants (9 taking metformin), only 1 developed LS (p = 0.025, OR = 0.13 {95% CI 0.051-3.27}). A refined binary logistic regression model showed that patients receiving unilateral radiation (p = 0.019, OR = 2.06 {95% CI 0.15-0.84}) were more likely to develop LS. Higher V<sub>40Gy</sub> (p = 0.047, OR = 1.06 {95% CI 1.00-1.12}), and younger age (mean age 56.6 vs 59.7, p = 0.060, OR = 0.96 {95% CI 0.92-1.00}) were associated with elevated risk of LS, with borderline significance.

A prospective, longitudinal and experimental study was performed in patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Hospital General de México. They were divided in two groups: first group received chemotherapy + metformin (850 mg three times a day); second group only received standard chemotherapy. The sample was randomized 3:1 in favor of the second group. 93 patients were included (73 treated with chemotherapy + metformin and 20 received standard chemotherapy), with 303 ± 53 days of follow-up. Complete remission was higher in the group without metformin (81.3 % [n = 61] versus 70 % [n = 14]), which also presented more patients with relapse (47.9 % versus 25 %). Overall survival at one year was of 68 % and free survival disease was 64 %, without significant differences between groups. Absence of metformin was the only variable of adverse prognostic considered significant (p = 0.55). Cox regression showed that adding metfomin reduced 56 % the risk of relapse. The adding metformin to the treatment of leukemias showed that was useful in our research.

(2) Methods: In a nationwide population-based longitudinal study, data were retrieved from the 1998 to 2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. ICD9-CM codes 256.4, 710.0, and 642.X were identified for the corresponding diagnoses of PCOS, SLE, and GH-PE, respectively, which were further confirmed by inspection of medical claims data for ultrasonography findings, laboratory tests, blood pressure measurements and examinations of urine protein to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. To clarify the risks of primiparous GH-PE, the study excluded women diagnosed with PCOS or SLE at <15 or >45 years of age, pre-existing chronic hypertension, GH-PE before PCOS and SLE, and abortion or termination before 20 weeks' gestation. For women affected by prepregnancy PCOS or SLE individually, each pregnant woman was age-matched to four pregnant women without PCOS or SLE. Logistic regression analyses were applied to report odds ratios (ORs) for the risks of GH-PE after adjustment for age, occupation, urbanization, economic status, and other co-morbidities. (3) Results: Among 8070 and 2430 women with prepregnancy PCOS and SLE retrieved from a population of 1,000,000 residents, 1953 (24.20%) and 820 (33.74%) had subsequent primiparous pregnancies that were analyzable and compared with 7812 and 3280 pregnancies without prepregnancy PCOS and SLE, respectively. GH-PE occurred more frequently in pregnancies with prepregnancy PCOS (5.79% vs. 2.23%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and SLE (3.41% vs. 1.80%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) as compared to those without PCOS and SLE. Further analysis revealed that prepregnancy PCOS (adjusted OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.83-3.05) and SLE (adjusted OR = 1.95; 95%CI: 1.23-3.10) were individually associated with GH-PE. The risk of GH-PE was not reduced in women with prepregnancy PCOS receiving metformin treatment (<i>p =</i> 0.22). (4) Conclusions: Prepregnancy PCOS and SLE are independent and significant risk factors for the occurrence of GH-PE. Because the peripartum complications are much higher among pregnancies with GH-PE, the at-risk woman should be informed and well-prepared during her pregnancy and delivery.",

A pronounced decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity occurred as the pregnancies proceeded (at the third trimester 51.7% and 41.1% of pregestational values in patient 1 and 2 respectively), along with an increase in stimulated insulin secretion (at the third trimester 120% and 50.6% of pregestational values in patient 1 and 2 respectively). Despite these findings, none of the studied subjects developed gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. This confirms that metformin may exert a protective role against such disturbances in hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients, probably by avoiding the gestational physiologic changes leading to a loss of the metabolic balance achieved by these subjects out of pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Moving from the correlation between insulin-resistance and PCOS, metformin has been administered in some PCOS women improving ovulatory and metabolic functions and decreasing androgen levels. Inconsistency and unpredictability of response to metformin limit its extensive use. Aim of this study was to identify reliable predictors of response to metformin therapy for weight loss and reduction in plasma androgen levels using ANNs (artificial neural networks). One hundred eight consecutive women with PCOS (ESHRE/ASRM 2003 Rotterdam criteria) treated with metformin 1500 mg/day, at inclusion and every 6 months underwent to a complete clinical, endocrine/metabolic assessment and ultrasonographic evaluation. Therapy outcomes were BMI reduction (≥1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in overweight/obese and free-androgen-index (FAI) decrease (≥1%) in hyperandrogenemic women. Semantic connectivity maps (SCMs) were obtained through Auto-CM, a fourth generation ANN, to compare patients' baseline clinical features to the treatment outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the major predictor in drop-out patients and the associated risk. At 6 months 54 out of 103 (52,4%) obese patients showed BMI reduction and 45 out of 89 (50,6%) hyperandrogenemic women showed FAI decrease. The further response rates at 12 months were 30,6 and 47%, respectively. SCMs showed a clear polarization for both the outcomes with elevated accuracy. Treatment responsiveness resulted strictly related to oligo-amenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia at baseline. In addition, lower serum testosterone levels at baseline were found to be the major predictor of treatment discontinuation. In women with PCOS, menstrual pattern imbalance and ovarian androgens excess are the best predictors of metformin response. They may pave the way for a rethinking of the criteria for evaluating hyperandrogenism in order to better define the large population included in the diagnosis of PCOS. Baseline plasma testosterone level can serve as a sensitive marker to predict treatment compliance.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence from observational studies has suggested that metformin may be beneficial in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, to the authors' knowledge, none of these studies was conducted in a US population. Because environmental factors such as Western diet and obesity are implicated in the causation of CRC, a large case-control study was performed to assess the effects of metformin on the incidence of CRC in a US population. MarketScan databases were used to identify diabetic patients with CRC. A case was defined as having an incident diagnosis of CRC. Up to 2 controls matched for age, sex, and geographical region were selected for each case. Metformin exposure was assessed by prescription tracking within the 12-month period before the index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for multiple potential confounders and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs). The mean age of the study participants was 55 years and 57 years, respectively, in the control and case groups (P = 1.0). Approximately 60% of the study participants were male and 40% were female in each group. In the multivariable model, any metformin use was associated with a 15% reduction in the odds of CRC (AOR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.95 [P = .007]). After adjusting for health care use, the beneficial effect of metformin was reduced to 12% (AOR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.00 [P = .05]). The dose-response analyses demonstrated no significant association with metformin dose, duration, or total exposure. Metformin use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of developing CRC among diabetic patients in the United States.",

However, it is not known if it is acutely cardioprotective in patients taking metformin at the time of AMI. We compared patient outcomes according to metformin status at the time of admission for fatal and non-fatal AMI in a large cohort of patients in England. This study used linked data from primary care, hospital admissions and death registry from 4.7 million inhabitants in England, as part of the CALIBER resource. The primary endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction requiring hospitalisation, stroke and cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were heart failure (HF) hospitalisation and all-cause mortality. 4,030 patients with T2DM and incident AMI recorded between January 1998 and October 2010 were included. At AMI admission, 63.9% of patients were receiving metformin and 36.1% another oral hypoglycaemic drug. Median follow-up was 343 (IQR: 1-1436) days. Adjusted analyses showed an increased hazard of the composite endpoint in metformin users compared to non-users (HR 1.09 [1.01-1.19]), but not of the secondary endpoints. The higher risk of the composite endpoint in metformin users was only observed in people taking metformin at AMI admission, whereas metformin use post-AMI was associated with a reduction in risk of all-cause mortality (0.76 [0.62-0.93], P = 0.009). Our study suggests that metformin use at the time of first AMI is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM, while its use post-AMI might be beneficial. Further investigation in well-designed randomised controlled trials is indicated, especially in view of emerging evidence of cardioprotection from sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.",

Among 28 lean patients, 15 were treated with vaginal ring plus metformin and 13 women with only vaginal ring. The effects were assessed after six months. The patients were submitted to evaluation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; Doppler analysis of ophthalmic artery; brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation; and oral glucose tolerance test. After six months, the fasting insulin, glucose/insulin ratio, and homeostatic model assessment estimates for insulin resistance were significantly improved in metformin group. The ophthalmic artery pulsatility index did not significantly improve in either group. The brachial artery vasodilation was better in metformin treated patients. Metformin, associated with vaginal ring, improves the insulin and carbohydrate metabolism. This, associated with the significant improvements of surrogate markers of arterial function, may be responsible of a slight possible cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protective effect.",

      "abstract": "Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperinsulinemia; thus it has been postulated that insulin-lowering drugs, such as metformin, might be a useful long-term choice. We evaluated the effects of 6 months' administration of metformin on clinical and endocrine indices in PCOS patients. Forty-two hyperinsulinemic women with PCOS were continuously treated with metformin for 6 months. Gonadotropins, androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), insulin, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), lipid profile and clinical indices (menstrual length, body mass index (BMI), Ferriman-Gallwey score and waist/hip ratio (WHR)) were studied before and after metformin treatment. All women experienced a normalization of menstrual cycle length (reduction rate, 36.9%), a significant decrease in luteinizing hormone, insulin and androgen levels and an increase in SHBG plasma concentrations, with a concomitant decrease in cycle length and WHR. Significant changes were observed in the lipid profile. According to baseline androgen levels, patients were divided into two groups: 20 normoandrogenic and 17 hyperandrogenic women. The greatest decline of androgens, BMI and Ferriman-Gallwey score was observed in hyperandrogenic patients. Lowering of androgenicity was independent of BMI. Significant changes in lipid profile were observed in both groups after metformin treatment. These results suggest that metformin is effective in decreasing hyperandrogenism, mainly by reducing insulin levels. This leads to an improvement of clinical manifestations of PCOS and, in particular, of hyperandrogenism.",

Data were from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a longitudinal U.K. database. Rosiglitazone use was profiled from launch (2000) until withdrawal (2010). Patients discontinuing from July 2010 were included in the analysis to ascertain the impact on glycaemic control; therapy intensification; and progression to MACE, death and cancer. For comparison, patients were matched to those maintained on pioglitazone as a control group. Rosiglitazone use peaked in May 2007. Of patients prescribed rosiglitazone at discontinuation 54.1% patients used a dual-therapy regimen; most commonly with metformin (46.7%). 65.1% patients remained at the same stage of the diabetes pathway following discontinuation. 51.7% of patients replaced rosiglitazone with pioglitazone. Patients discontinuing were more likely (HR=2.29), to subsequently intensify therapy than controls. After discontinuation of rosiglitazone there was a significant increase in HbA1c, from a median of 6.9% to 7.3%. In matched analysis, there was a significantly greater increase in HbA1c for rosiglitazone patients (0.33% versus 0.10%). Following discontinuation, crude rates for MACE, cancer and mortality were 8.4, 17.9 and 15.8 pkpy, respectively. None was significantly different in the matched analysis. Withdrawal of rosiglitazone was associated with worsening glucose control and subsequent intensification of treatment regimen.",

The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of metformin use relative to nonuse for bacterial pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD, NIPPV, IMV, and lung cancer were 1.17 (1.11-1.23), 1.34 (1.26-1.43), 0.99 (0.89-1.10), 1.10 (1.03-1.17), and 1.12 (0.96-1.30). Metformin use also exhibited significant dose-response relationship with respect to the risks of bacterial pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD and IMV. Consistent results were found in the sensitivity test. This nationwide cohort study demonstrated that in patients with T2DM and COPD, metformin use was associated with higher risks of pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD, and IMV. If patients with COPD use metformin, vigilance with regard to their pulmonary condition may be required.",

PCOS has been associated with inflammation and metabolic syndrome (MetS); however, the moderating effects of inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and menopause on the PCOS-MetS association have not been studied in Hispanic/Latinas with PCOS who have a higher metabolic burden. We studied the cross-sectional association between PCOS and (1) MetS in 7316 females of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), (2) subcomponents of MetS including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated triglycerides (TGL), and (3) effect modification by menopausal status and CRP. The HCHS/SOL is a multicenter, longitudinal, and observational study of US Hispanic/Latinos. Our study sample included females from visit 2 with self-reported PCOS and MetS (ages 23-82 years). PCOS (prevalence = 18.8%) was significantly associated with MetS prevalence [odds ratio [odds ratio (OR) = 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.76)], IFG and TGL (OR = 1.42 (1.18-1.72), OR = 1.48 (1.20-1.83), respectively]. We observed effect modification by menopausal status (ORpre = 1.46, Pint= .02; ORpost = 1.34, Pint= .06) and CRP (ORelevated = 1.41, Pint= .04; ORnormal = 1.26, Pint= .16) on the PCOS-MetS association. We also observed a superadditive interaction between CRP and PCOS, adjusting for which resulted in an attenuated effect of PCOS on MetS (OR = 1.29 [0.93-1.78]). Hispanic/Latino females with PCOS had higher odds of MetS, IFG, and elevated TGL than their peers without PCOS. Interaction analyses revealed that the odds of MetS are higher among PCOS females who have premenopausal status or high inflammation. Interventions in Hispanic/Latinas should target these outcomes for effective management of the disease.",

The patients were assessed for spontaneous menstruation, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist/hip ratio (WHR), glucose and insulin concentrations under fasting conditions and after a 75-g glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. Spontaneous menstruation was observed in 81% of the women treated with metformin, with no changes in weight or BMI. Waist measurement and the WHR were reduced. The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) improved from 0.33 +/- 0.03 to 0.35 +/- 0.04 (p < 0.005), and serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were reduced, while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was increased. Serum testosterone concentrations were also reduced. There were no differences in serum triglycerides, SHBG or IGF-I. The occurrence of spontaneous menstruation and changes in the pattern of body fat distribution, the reduction in serum testosterone concentrations, the improvement in lipid profile and the reduction of insulinemia with the use of metformin permit us to conclude that treatment with this drug is of benefit to women with PCOS.",

Serum levels of AMH, insulin, glucose, testosterone, and quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI), were assessed before and after treatment in PCOS group.

PCOS women show positive correlation between AMH and testosterone (R = 0.83; p < 0.0001) only prior to treatment. Metformin treatment, lead to a significant decrease in serum insulin (p = 0.0132) and testosterone (p = 0.0017) levels. However, no alteration in AMH levels was observed after treatment. Despite the improvement of metabolic parameters and the reduction of androgen levels, AMH levels did not change after metformin treatment.

Longitudinal cohort study using insurance claims data from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2016 to identify patients with a first prescription, after metformin, of a second-line diabetes drug (eg sulphonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist) and to estimate their adherence to that drug class. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the association between insurance type and use of each drug class, and between insurance type and adherence to each drug class. The study population included 96,663 patients. Trends in drug use differed by insurance type. For example, sulphonylurea use declined among the commercially insured (from 46% to 39%, <i>p</i> < .001) but not among Medicare Advantage or dual-eligible patients. Patterns of adherence also differed between insurance groups. For example, compared to commercial insurance, Medicare Advantage was associated with higher adherence to sulphonylurea (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% CI 1.21-1.43)) but lower adherence to SGLT-2 inhibitors (OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.33-0.56)). This study finds differences in utilization and adherence for diabetes drugs across insurance types. Older medications such as sulphonylureas appear to be more used and better adhered to among Medicare Advantage recipients, while the opposite is true for newer medication classes. These findings suggest a need to personalize selection of diabetes drugs according to insurance status, particularly when adherence needs optimization.",

Stage at diagnosis, categorized as early and advanced, was the primary outcome. Chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics and logistic regression models were applied to examine the effect while controlling for patient's characteristics. A total of 1,719 female BC patients used ADM while 6,084 patients were non-ADM users. Although a higher proportion of ADM users (20.36%) were diagnosed with advanced stage compared to the non-ADM users (14.46%), the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for the patients' characteristics. Besides, insulin users were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage (adjusted odds ratio 1.69; 95% CI 1.15, 2.48) compared to metformin users. The association between ADM use and BC diagnostic characteristics varied based on different treatments.",

We assessed the hypothesis that diet-metformin (MET) lessens the physiological gestational increase in IR and reduces gestational weight gain, thus reducing GD. Preconception, in an out-patient clinical research centre, MET 1.5 (eight pregnancies) to 2.55 g/day (34 pregnancies) was started. Women with body mass index <25 or >or=25 kg/m(2) were given a 2000 or 1500 calorie/day, high-protein (26% of calories), low-carbohydrate (44%) diet. Calorie restrictions were dropped after conception. On MET, GD developed in three out of 42 pregnancies (7.1%). Median entry weight (94.5 kg) fell to 82.7 on MET at the last preconception visit (P = 0.0001), fell further to 81.6 during the first trimester, was 83.6 in the second trimester, and 89.1 kg in the third trimester. Median weight gain during pregnancy was 3.5 kg. The median percentage reduction in serum insulin was 40% on MET at the last preconception visit; insulin did not increase in the first or second trimesters (P > 0.05), and rose 10% in the third trimester. The median percentage reduction in HOMA IR was 46% on MET at the last preconception visit; IR did not increase (P > 0.05) in the first, second or third trimesters. HOMA insulin secretion fell 45% on MET at the last preconception visit, did not increase in the first trimester, rose 24% in the second trimester, and rose 109% in the third trimester. Testosterone fell 30% on MET at the last preconception visit (P = 0.01) and then rose 74, 61 and 95% during trimesters 1, 2 and 3; median testosterone during the third trimester did not differ from pre-treatment levels. By reducing preconception weight, insulin, IR, insulin secretion and testosterone, and by maintaining these insulin-sensitizing effects throughout pregnancy, MET-diet reduces the likelihood of developing GD, and prevents androgen excess for the fetus.",

The effects of metformin on women with PCOS during 24 months with respect to menses, hormones, and metabolic profiles are assessed. Prospective cohort. A reproductive endocrinology clinic in a university-affiliated medical center. One hundred nineteen women with PCOS, defined by the Rotterdam criteria, were enrolled. Metformin was given daily for 24 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with regular menstruation during treatment. Changes in anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic parameters were also assessed. Analyses were performed using segmented regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation methodology. Outcomes are expressed as magnitude of change from the baseline. Both overweight (OW) and normal-weight (NW) women with PCOS had increased menstrual frequency and decreased body mass index (BMI), testosterone, and luteinizing hormone levels in the first 6 months. Further stratification showed that NW women exhibiting elevated testosterone at baseline had the largest magnitude of improvement at 6 months [odds ratio (OR), 7.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.35 to 22.17], whereas OW patients with normal testosterone were most likely to achieve normal menses at 12 months (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Metformin was associated with improvements in the menstrual cycle and most hormonal profiles in OW and NW women with PCOS during 24 months of treatment. Most parameters reached maximal response and steady-state after 6 months. Phenotypic differences in baseline BMI and testosterone level can be used as patient selection criteria or treatment prognostics.",

      "abstract": "In normal subjects, the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are responsible for 70% of the insulin response during a meal; but in diabetic subjects and other insulin-resistant conditions, the incretin effect is impaired. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance, and the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind PCOS resemble those of type 2 diabetes mellitus; therefore, women with PCOS may have alterations in the incretin hormone response. Metformin is widely used in the treatment of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCOS. Metformin may exert some of its effect on glucose metabolism by increasing GLP-1 biosynthesis and secretion and thereby increasing the incretin effect. The objective of the study was to measure incretin hormone secretion in women with PCOS and to evaluate the effect of metformin treatment. Cross-sectional comparison of 40 women with PCOS (19 lean and 21 obese) and 26 healthy control women (9 lean and 17 obese) and longitudinal evaluation of the effects of 8 months of metformin 1000 mg twice daily in women with PCOS were performed. Plasma concentrations of GIP and GLP-1 were determined frequently during a 75-g glucose tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. The incretin hormone response did not differ between subjects with and without PCOS. Subgroup analysis showed lower GIP (area under the curve [AUC]) levels in obese women with PCOS compared with obese control women (P < .05) and compared with lean women with PCOS (P < .05). Metformin increased GIP (AUC) and GLP-1 (AUC) in lean women with PCOS (P < .05), and a similar trend was seen in the obese women (P = .07). The GIP secretion is attenuated in obese women with PCOS, whereas treatment with metformin increases the levels of both GIP and GLP-1 in women with PCOS.",

      "abstract": "This post hoc analysis from the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) 2 trial reports on extended long-term outcome in relation to glucose-lowering agents in patients with myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomised as follows: group 1, insulin-based treatment; group 2, insulin during hospitalisation followed by conventional glucose control; and group 3, conventional treatment. Treatment according to the above protocol lasted 2.1 years. Using the total DIGAMI 2 cohort as an epidemiological database, this study presents mortality rates in the randomised groups, and mortality and morbidity rates by glucose-lowering treatment during an extended period of follow-up (median 4.1 and max 8.1 years). Follow-up data were available in 1,145 of the 1,253 patients. The mortality rate was 31% (72% cardiovascular) without significant differences between treatment groups. The total number of fatal malignancies was 37, with a trend towards a higher risk in group 1. The HR for death from malignant disease, compared with group 2, was 1.77 (95% CI 0.87-3.61; p = 0.11) and 3.60 (95% CI 1.24-10.50; p = 0.02) compared with group 3. Insulin treatment was associated with non-fatal cardiovascular events (OR 1.89 95% CI 1.35-2.63; p = 0.0002), but not with mortality (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93-1.81; p = 0.13). Metformin was associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p = 0.01) and a lower risk of death from malignancies (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.83; p = 0.02). Patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarction have a poor prognosis. Glucose-lowering drugs appear to be of prognostic importance. Insulin may be associated with an increased risk of non-fatal cardiac events, while metformin seems to be protective against risk of death.",

Metformin, Myoinositol and d-chiro-inositol acts as insulin sensitizers and exerts a beneficial effects in PCOS. The objective is to compare the effect of metformin monotherapy versus a combination of metformin with Myoinositol and d-chiro-inositol in PCOS. This study is a randomized controlled trial conducted over a period of 6 months. All overweight and obese women with PCOS with the age group between 18 and 35 were included and randomized into two groups, 27 in the metformin monotherapy arm and 26 in the myoinositol combination arm. The variables assessed were duration of menstrual cycle, anthropometric parameters, modified Ferriman Gallwey score, global acne score, Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, fasting lipid profile, serum testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, anti-Mullerian hormone, and pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian volume, PCOS Questionnaire score. Changes in the parameters from baseline at the end of 6 months of treatment were assessed and compared between the groups. Menstrual cycle regularity improved in both groups with significantly greater improvement in the group receiving myoinositol-based therapy (p < .001). Pregnancy rate was equal in both the arms. There was a significant improvement in PCOSQ score in myoinositol-based therapy group (p < .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in other hormonal, metabolic parameters between two groups in spite of symptomatic benefits. The addition of myoinositol to metformin exerts additional benefits in improving menstrual cycle regularity, and quality of life in women with PCOS.",

Metabolic complications are common in patients suffering PCOS, including obesity, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes, which severely compromise the clinical course of affected women. Yet, therapeutic options remain mostly symptomatic and of limited efficacy for the metabolic and reproductive alterations of PCOS. We report here the hormonal, metabolic and gonadal responses to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1)-based multi-agonists, GLP1/Estrogen (GLP1/E), GLP1/gastric inhibitory peptide (GLP1/GIP) and GLP1/GIP/Glucagon, in two mouse PCOS models, with variable penetrance of metabolic and reproductive traits, and their comparison with metformin. Our data illustrate the superior efficacy of GLP1/E vs. other multi-agonists and metformin in the management of metabolic complications of PCOS; GLP1/E ameliorates also ovarian cyclicity in an ovulatory model of PCOS, without direct estrogenic uterotrophic effects. In keeping with GLP1-mediated brain targeting, quantitative proteomics reveals changes in common and distinct hypothalamic pathways in response to GLP1/E between the two PCOS models, as basis for differential efficiency. Altogether, our data set the basis for the use of GLP1-based multi-agonists, and particularly GLP1/E, in the personalized management of PCOS.",

Insulin-sensitizer agents such as metformin and inositols have been shown to improve the endocrine and metabolic aspects of PCOS. The purpose of this study is to compare their effects on the clinical and metabolic features of the women with PCOS. Fifty PCOS women with IR and/or hyperinsulinemia were randomized to treatment with metformin (1500 mg/day) or myo-inositol (4 g/day). IR was defined as HOMA-IR >2.5, while hyperinsulinemia was defined as a value of AUC for insulin after a glucose load over the cutoff of our laboratory obtained in normal women. The Matsusa Index has been calculated. The women have been evaluated for insulin secretion, BMI, menstrual cycle length, acne and hirsutism, at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. The results obtained in both groups were similar. The insulin sensitivity improved in both treatment groups. The BMI significantly decreased and the menstrual cycle was normalized in about 50% of the women. No significant changes in acne and hirsutism were observed. The two insulin-sensitizers, metformin and myo-inositol, show to be useful in PCOS women in lowering BMI and ameliorating insulin sensitivity, and improving menstrual cycle without significant differences between the two treatments.",

      "abstract": "PCOS is a common metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age, which pathogenesis is very complex. The role of ferroptosis in PCOS is a novel finding, and the mechanistic studies are not clear. Metformin is a commonly used drug of PCOS but few studies on whether metformin can improve the follicle development and ovarian function in PCOS. We aims to use PCOS mouse model to study the effect of metformin on PCOS based on the ovarian function and explored the regulation of metformin in PCOS mice by intervening in ferroptosis pathway. C57 BL/6J female mice aged 4-5 weeks were purchased and gavaged with letrozole (1 mg/kg/day) combined with high-fat diet for 21days to establish PCOS model, and control group was set up. After modeling, the mice were divided into PCOS model group and metformin treatment group (Met) (n=6).The Met group were gavaged metformin (200 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. The body weight, estrous cycle, glucose tolerance test (OGTT)and insulin resistance test (ITT) were monitored. Then, The mice were euthanized to collect serum and ovaries. Elisa was used to detect changes in related serum hormones (E2, LH, FSH, TP). Ovaries used for molecular biology experiments to detect changes in GPX4, SIRT3, AMPK/p-AMPK, and mTOR/p-mTOR by Western blot and qPCR. Compared with the model group mice, body weight was significantly reduced, and their estrous cycle was restored in Met group. The results of OGTT and ITT showed an improvment of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Morphological results showed that after metformin treatment, polycystic lesions in ovaries were reduced, the ovarian function was restored, and the expressions of SIRT3 and GPX4 were elevated. WB results demonstrated that the expressions of p-mTOR and p-AMPK in ovaries were significantly reduced in Model group, but reversed in MET group. Our study confirmed metformin could not only improve body weight and metabolism disorders, but also improve ovarian dysfunction in PCOS mice.In addition, we explored metformin could regulate ferroptosis to improve PCOS <i>via</i> the SIRT3/AMPK/mTOR pathway. Our study complements the mechanisms by which metformin improves PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Does acupuncture improve insulin sensitivity more effectively than metformin or sham acupuncture in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance (IR)? Among women with PCOS and IR, acupuncture was not more effective than metformin or sham acupuncture in improving insulin sensitivity. Uncontrolled trials have shown that acupuncture improved insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects compared with metformin in women with PCOS and IR. However, data from randomized trials between acupuncture and metformin or sham acupuncture are lacking. This was a three-armed randomized controlled trial enrolling a total of 342 women with PCOS and IR from three hospitals between November 2015 and February 2018, with a 3-month follow-up until October 2018. Women aged from 18 to 40 years with PCOS and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥2.14 were randomly assigned (n = 114 per group) to receive true acupuncture plus placebo (true acupuncture), metformin plus sham acupuncture (metformin, 0.5 g three times daily) or sham acupuncture plus placebo (sham acupuncture) for 4 months, with an additional 3-month follow-up. True or sham acupuncture was given three times per week, and 0.5 g metformin or placebo was given three times daily. The primary outcome was change in HOMA-IR from baseline to 4 months after baseline visit. Secondary outcomes included changes in the glucose AUC during an oral glucose tolerance test, BMI and side effects at 4 months after baseline visit. After 4 months of treatment, the changes of HOMA-IR were -0.5 (decreased 14.7%) in the true acupuncture group, -1.0 (decreased 25.0%) in the metformin group and -0.3 (decreased 8.6%) in the sham acupuncture group, when compared with baseline. True acupuncture is not as effective as metformin in improving HOMA-IR at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1). No significant difference was found in change in HOMA-IR between true and sham acupuncture groups at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.3). During the 4 months of treatment, gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent in the metformin group, including diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting and stomach discomfort (31.6%, 13.2%, 11.4%, 8.8%, 14.0% and 8.8%, respectively). Bruising was more common in the true acupuncture group (14.9%). This study might have underestimated the sample size in the true acupuncture group with 4 months of treatment to enable detection of statistically significant changes in HOMA-IR with fixed acupuncture (i.e. a non-personalized protocol). Participants who withdrew because of pregnancy did not have further blood tests and this can introduce bias. True acupuncture did not improve insulin sensitivity as effectively as metformin in women with PCOS and IR, but it is better than metformin in improving glucose metabolism (which might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes) and has less side effects. Metformin had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects than acupuncture groups, and thus acupuncture might be a non-pharmacological treatment with low risk for women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture combined with metformin on insulin sensitivity in these women.

Reprogramming metabolic pathways could improve the ability of metabolic inhibitors to suppress cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)<sup>1,3</sup>. Here we show that BTB and CNC homology1 (BACH1)<sup>4</sup>, a haem-binding transcription factor that is increased in expression in tumours from patients with TNBC, targets mitochondrial metabolism. BACH1 decreases glucose utilization in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and negatively regulates transcription of electron transport chain (ETC) genes. BACH1 depletion by shRNA or degradation by hemin sensitizes cells to ETC inhibitors such as metformin<sup>5,6</sup>, suppressing growth of both cell line and patient-derived tumour xenografts. Expression of a haem-resistant BACH1 mutant in cells that express a short hairpin RNA for BACH1 rescues the BACH1 phenotype and restores metformin resistance in hemin-treated cells and tumours<sup>7</sup>. Finally, BACH1 gene expression inversely correlates with ETC gene expression in tumours from patients with breast cancer and in other tumour types, which highlights the clinical relevance of our findings. This study demonstrates that mitochondrial metabolism can be exploited by targeting BACH1 to sensitize breast cancer and potentially other tumour tissues to mitochondrial inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death initiated by inflammasomes and is critical for immunity. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays multiple roles in inflammatory response and immunity. Metformin can activate SIRT1 to participate in different biological processes and exert its anticancer effects. However, the mechanism by which metformin activates SIRT1 to drive cancer cell pyroptosis has not been reported. In this study, we treated cancer cells with metformin for diverse periods of time (0-24 h) and found that cell viability was decreased obviously. Interestingly, pyroptosis occurred when cancer cells were treated with metformin for the indicated time (4, 8 and 12 h), which was elucidated by the cell swelling and bubbles blowing in the membrane. Metformin also increased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, an indication of pyroptotic cell cytotoxicity) remarkably. The underlying mechanisms were that metformin enhanced AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and further increased NF-κB p65 expression to stimulate Bax activation and cytochrome c release, triggering caspase3 cleavage of GSDME, which is a characteristic pyroptotic marker. Depletion of SIRT1 inhibited metformin-induced these protein expression, revealing that metformin promotes AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling to drive cancer cell pyroptosis. Meantime, metformin induced mitochondrial dysfunction to trigger activation of caspase3 and generation of GSDME-N. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction activated AMPK/SIRT1 pathway to cause pyroptotic death upon metformin treatment. This research firstly reveals that metformin as a sensitizer amplifies AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling to induce caspase3/GSDME-mediated cancer cell pyroptosis. Induction of cellular pyroptosis by metformin is considered as a novel therapeutic option against various cancers.",

Sixty overweight patients with PCOS were recruited from January 2021 to January 2022 in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University and were randomly assigned to the MET or combination (COM) group to receive 12 weeks of MET monotherapy or MET plus LIRA therapy. Anthropometric measurements, menstrual cycle changes, gonadal profiles, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted at baseline and after the 12-week treatment. Fifty-two subjects completed the trial while eight were lost during the follow-up. Both MET and COM improved menstrual cycles, anthropometric parameters, and glucose metabolism after the 12-week treatment; however, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. MET plus LIRA therapy improved hyperandrogenemia, including TT (total testosterone), SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) and FAI (free androgen index), whereas MET monotherapy only improved SHBG and FAI when compared with baseline. Furthermore, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved E2 (estradiol) while only MET plus LIRA therapy improved LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and Prog (progesterone) more effectively than baseline. Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy may improve TT, SHBG, FAI, LH and Prog more effectively than MET monotherapy; however, there were no significant differences on E2, FSH and LH/FSH between the two groups. In overweight patients with PCOS, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved glucose metabolism and relieved insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy was more effective than MET monotherapy in improving reproductive abnormalities and hyperandrogenemia, potentially by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common and fatal type of cancer in men. Metastatic PCa (mPCa) is a major factor contributing to its lethality, although the mechanisms remain poorly understood. PTEN is one of the most frequently deleted genes in mPCa. Here we show a frequent genomic co-deletion of PTEN and STAT3 in liquid biopsies of patients with mPCa. Loss of Stat3 in a Pten-null mouse prostate model leads to a reduction of LKB1/pAMPK with simultaneous activation of mTOR/CREB, resulting in metastatic disease. However, constitutive activation of Stat3 led to high LKB1/pAMPK levels and suppressed mTORC1/CREB pathway, preventing mPCa development. Metformin, one of the most widely prescribed therapeutics against type 2 diabetes, inhibits mTORC1 in liver and requires LKB1 to mediate glucose homeostasis. We find that metformin treatment of STAT3/AR-expressing PCa xenografts resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth accompanied by diminished mTORC1/CREB, AR and PSA levels. PCa xenografts with deletion of STAT3/AR nearly completely abrogated mTORC1/CREB inhibition mediated by metformin. Moreover, metformin treatment of PCa patients with high Gleason grade and type 2 diabetes resulted in undetectable mTORC1 levels and upregulated STAT3 expression. Furthermore, PCa patients with high CREB expression have worse clinical outcomes and a significantly increased risk of PCa relapse and metastatic recurrence. In summary, we have shown that STAT3 controls mPCa via LKB1/pAMPK/mTORC1/CREB signaling, which we have identified as a promising novel downstream target for the treatment of lethal mPCa.",

Here, we show that the energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) governs gastric epithelial progenitor differentiation. Administering the AMPK activator metformin decreases epithelial progenitor proliferation and increases acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) in mice and organoids. AMPK activation targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to govern progenitor proliferation and PC fate choice, and PGC1α, which we show controls PC maturation after their specification. PC-specific deletion of AMPKα or PGC1α causes defective PC maturation, which could not be rescued by metformin. However, metformin treatment still increases KLF4 levels and suppresses progenitor proliferation. Thus, AMPK activates KLF4 in progenitors to reduce self-renewal and promote PC fate, whereas AMPK-PGC1α activation within the PC lineage promotes maturation, providing a potential suggestion for why metformin increases acid secretion and reduces gastric cancer risk in humans.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder affecting premenopausal women, is associated with various metabolic consequences such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, though effective, often leads to significant gastrointestinal adverse effects or weight gain, limiting its suitability for women with PCOS. There is an urgent need for safe, effective and affordable agents. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, enhances glucose elimination through urine, thereby reducing body weight and improving glucose and lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, it is not currently recommended as a therapeutic option for PCOS in clinical guidelines. In this study, we systematically examined the impact of dapagliflozin on an obese PCOS mouse model, focusing on alterations in glucose metabolism, adipose tissue morphology, and plasma lipid profile. Obese PCOS was induced in mice by continuous dihydrotestosterone (DHEA) injections over 21 days and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. PCOS mice were then orally gavaged with dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg), metformin (50 mg/kg), or vehicle daily for 8 weeks, respectively. Our results demonstrated that dapagliflozin significantly prevented body weight gain and reduced fat mass in obese PCOS mice. Meanwhile, dapagliflozin treatment improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity compared to the control PCOS mice. Furthermore, dapagliflozin significantly improved adipocyte accumulation and morphology in white adipose tissue, resulting in a normalized plasma lipid profile in PCOS mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that dapagliflozin is an effective agent in managing glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in obese PCOS mice.",

The effect of intestinal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation was evaluated through metformin administration, the most commonly used AMPK activator. We analyzed metabolic parameters, ovulatory functions, gut microbiota composition, and serum levels of Indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3A), a metabolite involved in inflammation and apoptosis regulation. Metformin treatment significantly reversed metabolic disorders and restored ovulatory functions in PCOS rats. Moreover, metformin treatment led to notable improvements in gut microbiota composition and an increase in serum I3A levels, which have been shown to mitigate inflammation and apoptosis. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting intestinal AMPK in managing PCOS. By improving both metabolic and reproductive health, activation of AMPK may offer a promising approach for restoring physiological balance in PCOS patients.",

Hyperinsulinemia exacerbates oxidative stress, contributing to PCOS pathogenesis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and insulin sensitizer that shows promise as a therapeutic for PCOS. Our current study aimed to investigate the effects of NAC supplementation on endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and its effect on ovulation induction (OI) efficacy in women with PCOS. Female C57BL/6 mice were orally administered letrozole (LE) to induce PCOS and then randomly divided into groups receiving daily oral administration of 160 mg/kg NAC (PCOS + NAC group), 200 mg/kg metformin (PCOS + Met group), or 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (drug solvent) (pure PCOS group) for 12 days. Healthy female mice served as pure controls. Estrous cycles were monitored during the intervention. Metabolic and hormone levels, ovarian phenotypes, antioxidant activity in ovarian tissues, and oxidative stress levels in oocytes were assessed post-intervention. Furthermore, a pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted with 230 PCOS women, randomly assigned to the NAC group (1.8 g/day oral NAC, n = 115) or the control group (n = 115). Patients in both groups underwent ≤ 3 cycles of OI with sequential LE and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (uFSH). Cycle characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups. Similar to metformin, NAC supplementation significantly improved the estrous cycles and ovarian phenotypes of PCOS mice; reduced the LH concentration, LH/FSH ratio, and T level; and increased glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity. Notably, NAC significantly reduced oocyte ROS levels and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in PCOS mice. Additionally, NAC significantly enhanced enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities in PCOS mouse ovaries, whereas metformin had no such effect. In the clinical trial, compared to women in the control group, women receiving NAC had significantly lower average uFSH dosage and duration (p < 0.005) and significantly greater clinical pregnancy rates per OI cycle and cumulative clinical pregnancy rates per patient (p < 0.005). NAC supplementation improved endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and significantly enhanced OI efficacy with sequential LE and uFSH in women with PCOS. Therefore, NAC could be a valuable adjuvant in OI for women with PCOS.",

To examine the impact of HCQ on glucose and lipid metabolism as well as sex hormone levels in obese women with PCOS. Fifty obese women with PCOS were randomly allocated into two groups: HCQ group (n = 25) and metformin (MET) group (n = 25). The HCQ group received a daily dose of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine, while the MET group received a daily dose of 1000 mg metformin. Body fat parameters, glucose and lipid metabolism levels, as well as hormone levels were evaluated. Additionally, the incidence of pregnancy within six months following treatment was also assessed. Network pharmacology was also employed to analyze the potential molecular mechanism. Patients in the HCQ group (n = 20) and MET group (n = 23) were ultimately included for analysis. Following treatment, both groups exhibited significant improvements in body fat distribution and glucose metabolism status, with the HCQ group demonstrating a notable advantage over the MET group in increasing insulin sensitivity index (ISI)(HCQ:1.87 ± 0.21,MET:1.75 ± 0.29). Serum lipid levels [Serum total cholesterol(TC, mmol/L)(HCQ:4.51 ± 0.87,MET:5.05 ± 0.65), triglyceride(TG, mmol/L)(HCQ:1.36 ± 0.51,MET:1.67 ± 0.72), low-density lipoprotein (LDL, mmol/L)(HCQ:2.66 ± 0.98,MET:0.47 ± 1.42),decreased in both groups post-treatment, with the HCQ group displaying clear advantages compared to the MET group. The improvement of sex hormone levels was not pronounced in either group, although there was an overall downward trend. The potential benefits of HCQ in the management of in obese women with PCOS include significant improvements in body fat distribution, glucose and lipid metabolism levels, as well as correction of hormonal disorders. The study was officially registered as a clinical trial on April 17, 2022, with the registration number ChiCTR2200058816. https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=160099 .",

      "abstract": "The first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is lifestyle modification. However, it is currently unknown whether digital medicine can assist patients with PCOS in maintaining a healthy lifestyle while alleviating PCOS symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based digital intervention versus metformin treatment in women with PCOS and insulin resistance. A total of 80 women with PCOS and insulin resistance were recruited from an endocrinology clinic and randomly assigned to receive either a WeChat-based digital intervention (n=40, 50%) or metformin (n=40, 50%) for 12 weeks. The WeChat-based digital intervention consisted of 3 modules; a coach assisted the patients in using the intervention. The primary outcome was the change in a homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. At baseline and after the 12-week intervention, anthropometric parameters, menstruation frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic factors, and body fat distribution were measured in the clinic. Furthermore, self-assessed web-based questionnaires on diet, exercise, sleep, anxiety, and depression were obtained. A total of 72 participants completed the follow-up (for a 90% follow-up rate), including 35 of 40 (88%) participants from the digital intervention group and 37 of 40 (93%) participants from the metformin group. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance in the digital intervention group was significantly improved after 12 weeks of treatment with a mean change of -0.93 (95% CI -1.64 to -0.23), but no statistical difference was observed between the groups (least squares mean difference -0.20; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.58; P=.62). Both digital intervention and metformin treatment significantly improved menstruation frequency (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001) and reduced body weight (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001) and total fat mass (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001). Furthermore, the digital intervention had a significant advantage over metformin in improving waist circumference (least squares mean difference -1.84; 95% CI -3.44 to -0.24; P=.03), waist-to-hip ratio (least squares mean difference -0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; P=.03), total fat mass (least squares mean difference -1.59; 95% CI -2.88 to -0.30; P=.02), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (least squares mean difference -69.73; 95% CI -129.70 to -9.75; P=.02). In terms of safety, the main adverse events were sensations of hunger in the digital intervention group (2/40, 5%) and gastrointestinal adverse events in the metformin group (12/40, 30%). Our data suggest that digital intervention is an effective treatment option for patients with PCOS, with an efficacy comparable to that of metformin, and that it can also alleviate the negative effects of medications and make it easier and more efficient to adhere to lifestyle treatments. WeChat-based digital interventions have the potential to provide a new path for the improvement and health of women with PCOS in China.

Combined anticancer drug-treatment, along with, their enhanced delivery, can effectively kill cancer through multiple pathways. Nano-cubosomes are emerging as nanocarriers for anticancer therapies, hence, we constructed nano-cubosomes bearing cisplatin and cisplatin-metformin combination for investigation on HCT-116 cells. Nano-cubosomes bearing either cisplatin alone or cisplatin-metformin combination were formulated using emulsification technique. The loaded nano-cubosomes were characterized in vitro and the optimized formulation was selected. Their cytotoxic effects were investigated by Sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The AMPK/mTOR metabolic pathway as well as the Akt/mTOR pathway were analyzed using ELISA technique. Colorimetry was used in NADPH oxidase, LDH and caspase-3 activity determination. nano-cubosomal formulations exhibited superior cytotoxic effect compared to unformulated cisplatin. This cytotoxic effect was profound upon incorporation of metformin, an indirect mTOR inhibitor, in cisplatin nano-cubosomes. The induced CRC cell apoptosis was through inhibition of several metabolic pathways, namely, AMPK/mTOR and Akt/mTOR. Drug-loaded nano-cubosomes ensued depletion in glucose and energy levels that led to AMPK activation and thus mTOR inhibition. mTOR was additionally inhibited via suppression of p-Akt (Ser473) levels after nano-cubosomal treatment. Moreover, drug-loaded nano-cubosomes produced a notable escalation in ROS levels, evident as an increase in NADPH oxidase, inhibition of LDH and a consequential upsurge in caspase-3. These results demonstrated the influence exerted by cisplatin-loaded nano-cubosomes on CRC cell survival and enhancement of their cytotoxicity upon metformin addition.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a complex metabolic syndrome that is characterized by prolonged high blood glucose levels and frequently associated with life-threatening complications<sup>1,2</sup>. Epidemiological studies have suggested that diabetes is also linked to an increased risk of cancer<sup>3-5</sup>. High glucose levels may be a prevailing factor that contributes to the link between diabetes and cancer, but little is known about the molecular basis of this link and how the high glucose state may drive genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that result in a cancer phenotype. Here we show that hyperglycaemic conditions have an adverse effect on the DNA 5-hydroxymethylome. We identify the tumour suppressor TET2 as a substrate of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates TET2 at serine 99, thereby stabilizing the tumour suppressor. Increased glucose levels impede AMPK-mediated phosphorylation at serine 99, which results in the destabilization of TET2 followed by dysregulation of both 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the tumour suppressive function of TET2 in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin protects AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 99, thereby increasing TET2 stability and 5hmC levels. These findings define a novel 'phospho-switch' that regulates TET2 stability and a regulatory pathway that links glucose and AMPK to TET2 and 5hmC, which connects diabetes to cancer. Our data also unravel an epigenetic pathway by which metformin mediates tumour suppression. Thus, this study presents a new model for how a pernicious environment can directly reprogram the epigenome towards an oncogenic state, offering a potential strategy for cancer prevention and treatment.",

Although it is known to systemically affect glucose metabolism in liver, muscle, gut, and other tissues, the molecular determinants that predict a patient response in cancer remain unknown. Here, we carry out an integrative metabolomics analysis of metformin action in ovarian cancer. Metformin accumulated in patient biopsies, and pathways involving nucleotide metabolism, redox, and energy status, all related to mitochondrial metabolism, were affected in treated tumors. Strikingly, a metabolic signature obtained from a patient with an exceptional clinical outcome mirrored that of a responsive animal tumor. Mechanistically, we demonstrate with stable isotope tracing that these metabolic signatures are due to an inability to adapt nutrient utilization in the mitochondria. This analysis provides new insights into mitochondrial metabolism and may lead to more precise indications of metformin in cancer.",

Women with PCOS were identified using the Androgen Excess Society's criteria, and 60 participants were enrolled and divided equally into two groups. One group received a 40:1 ratio of MI plus DCI, while the other received metformin for a 12-week period. Endocrine and metabolic parameters, insulin-resistance, stress levels, and quality of life were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Both MI plus DCI and metformin significantly improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, p < 0.001), SHBG levels (p = 0.021), ovarian volume (p < 0.001), and menstrual regularity (p = 0.002), along with BMI, quality of life, and PSS scores (p < 0.001). Metformin showed slightly better outcomes in certain parameters, such as insulin sensitivity and endocrine markers, probably due to a higher representation of Phenotype A. In contrast, we hypothesize that MI plus DCI may be more effective for Phenotypes C and D. Our findings support both MI plus DCI and metformin as effective treatments for PCOS, with each treatment offering specific benefits. These results highlight the potential for a phenotype-specific tailored therapeutic approach to better manage the complex metabolic, endocrine, and stress-related challenges of PCOS.

The aim of this study was to apply radiomics analysis in metformin-induced radiosensitivity and finding radioproteomics associations of computed tomography (CT) imaging features and proteins involved in metformin radiosensitivity signaling pathways. A total of 32 female BALB/c mice were used in this study and were subjected to injection of breast cancer cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomly divided into the four groups including Control, Metformin, Radiation, and Radiation + Metformin. Western blot analysis was performed after treatment to measure expression of proteins including AMPK-alpha, phospho-AMPK-alpha (Thr172), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46), phospho-ACC (Ser79), and β-actin. CT imaging was performed before treatment and at the end of treatment in all groups. Radiomics features extracted from segmented tumors were selected using Elastic-net regression and were assessed in terms of correlation with expression of the proteins. It was observed that proteins including phospho-mTOR, phospho-4EBP1, and mTOR had positive correlations with changes in tumor volumes in days 28, 24, 20, 16, and 12, while tumor volume changes at these days had negative correlations with AMPK-alpha, phospho-AMPK-alpha, and phospho-ACC proteins. Furthermore, median feature had a positive correlation with AMPK-alpha, phospho-ACC, and phospho-AMPK-alpha proteins. Also, Cluster shade feature had positive correlations with mTOR and p-mTOR. On the other hand, LGLZE feature had negative correlations with AMPK-alpha and phospho-AMPK-alpha. Radiomics features can decode proteins that involved in response to metformin and radiation, although further studies are warranted to investigate the optimal way to integrate radiomics into biological experiments.",

      "abstract": "To assess chemerin levels and regulation in sera and adipose tissue from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and matched control subjects. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to assess mRNA and protein expression of chemerin. Serum chemerin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We investigated the in vivo effects of insulin on serum chemerin levels via a prolonged insulin-glucose infusion. Ex vivo effects of insulin, metformin, and steroid hormones on adipose tissue chemerin protein production and secretion into conditioned media were assessed by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Serum chemerin, subcutaneous, and omental adipose tissue chemerin were significantly higher in women with PCOS (n = 14; P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Hyperinsulinemic induction in human subjects significantly increased serum chemerin levels (n = 6; P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In adipose tissue explants, insulin significantly increased (n = 6; P < 0.05, P < 0.01) whereas metformin significantly decreased (n = 6; P < 0.05, P < 0.01) chemerin protein production and secretion into conditioned media, respectively. After 6 months of metformin treatment, there was a significant decrease in serum chemerin (n = 21; P < 0.01). Importantly, changes in homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance were predictive of changes in serum chemerin (P = 0.046). Serum and adipose tissue chemerin levels are increased in women with PCOS and are upregulated by insulin. Metformin treatment decreases serum chemerin in these women.",

Metformin-cytotoxicity was mainly dependent on glucose availability and reducing power generated by pentose phosphate pathway, whereas DCA cotreatment enhanced metformin-cytotoxicity via reprogramming glucose metabolism by inhibiting PDK and increasing mitochondrial respiration. DCA cotreatment elicited cell death rather than cell survival despite high glucose and high GSH condition. In conclusion, DCA sensitized metformin-cytotoxicity by reprogramming glucose metabolism in part from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidation, evidenced by measurements of glucose consumption, lactate release, and the ratio of oxygen consumption rate/extracellular acidification rate.",

      "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common and aggressive subtype of lung cancer, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health threat worldwide. Patients with LUAD and COVID-19 have a poor prognosis. Therefore, finding medications that can be used to treat COVID-19/LUAD patients is essential. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify 20 possible metformin target genes for the treatment of COVID-19/LUAD. PTEN and mTOR may serve as hub target genes of metformin. Metformin may be able to cure COVID-19/LUAD comorbidity through energy metabolism, oxidoreductase NADH activity, FoxO signalling pathway, AMPK signalling system, and mTOR signalling pathway, among other pathways, according to the results of bioinformatic research. Metformin has ability to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells, according to the results of colony formation and proliferation assays. In A549 cells, metformin increased glucose uptake and lactate generation, while decreasing ATP synthesis and the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. In summary, PTEN and mTOR may be potential targets of metformin for the treatment of COVID-19/LUAD. The mechanism by which metformin inhibits lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation may be related to glucose metabolism regulated by PI3K/AKT signalling and mTOR signalling pathways. Our study provides a new theoretical basis for the treatment of COVID-19/LUAD.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk of malignancy (mainly cancer of the pancreas, breast, colon, endometrium and bladder). In addition, there is evidence that antidiabetic medication may itself affect the risk of cancer. Importantly, metformin is nowadays emerging as an agent that has the potential to protect from cancer. Population studies have shown that metformin is associated with a significant reduction of neoplasias in general (and cancer of the breast and prostate, in particular). These observations are supported by in vitro and in vivo evidence that metformin inhibits the growth of cancer cells. The mechanisms underlying this protective potential of metformin are not completely understood. While other mechanisms have also been proposed, the protective action of metformin appears to be exerted by two main pathways. The first involves reduction of endogenous hyperinsulinemia. The second pathway relates to the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is recognized to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and growth. Whatever the precise mechanism, any reduction in the risk for cancer may be far-reaching, and this favorable effect adds to the clinical value of metformin as the mainstay of antidiabetic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is an old insulin sensitizer that has been widely used in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to treat metabolic comorbidities and may also improve ovarian dysfunction in women with PCOS. In fact, metformin may improve insulin resistance, a common finding of PCOS, and reduce insulin blood levels. In this way, androgen production rates can be reduced, and in a subset of women, menses abnormalities and ovulatory rates may improve. The current Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend the use of metformin during adolescence, particularly when excess body weight is present. In the presence of obesity and glucose intolerance states, particularly if those patients fail to modify their lifestyles, metformin may have some significant benefits. Finally, although this drug should not be used as a first-line treatment for ovulatory dysfunctions in adult women with PCOS, there are data supporting the suggestion that in many cases pretreatment with metformin may favor ovulatory response to clomiphene citrate. This article summarizes the available evidence in the favor of metformin use in women with PCOS and emphasizes the need for an individualized therapeutic approach.",

      "abstract": "Late-phase clinical trials investigating metformin as a cancer therapy are underway. However, there remains controversy as to the mode of action of metformin in tumors at clinical doses. We conducted a clinical study integrating measurement of markers of systemic metabolism, dynamic FDG-PET-CT, transcriptomics, and metabolomics at paired time points to profile the bioactivity of metformin in primary breast cancer. We show metformin reduces the levels of mitochondrial metabolites, activates multiple mitochondrial metabolic pathways, and increases 18-FDG flux in tumors. Two tumor groups are identified with distinct metabolic responses, an OXPHOS transcriptional response (OTR) group for which there is an increase in OXPHOS gene transcription and an FDG response group with increased 18-FDG uptake. Increase in proliferation, as measured by a validated proliferation signature, suggested that patients in the OTR group were resistant to metformin treatment. We conclude that mitochondrial response to metformin in primary breast cancer may define anti-tumor effect.",

Nevertheless, trials focused on SGLT-2 combination therapy's efficacy, and safety in PCOS patients are limited. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of CANA and metformin (MET) combination therapy and MET monotherapy in endocrine and metabolic profiles of overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Fifty-one overweight or obese non-diabetic PCOS women between 18 and 40 years old were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either CANA/MET or MET treatment. The CANA/MET group received CANA 100 mg once daily plus MET 1000 mg twice daily, while the MET group received MET 1000 mg twice daily for three months. Changes in menstrual pattern, anthropometric parameters, gonadal parameters, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Compared with the MET group, women have a significantly lower level of total testosterone (TT), area under the curve for glucose (AUCGlu), and area under the curve for insulin (AUCIns) to AUCGlu ratio in the combination group. There were no significant differences in menstrual frequency, body weight, body mass index, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, free androgen index, sex hormone-binding globulin, androstenedione, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, AUCIns, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and APO B/A1 ratio. AEs were seen in 57.70% (15/26) and 68.00% (17/25) of patients in the CANA/MET and MET groups, respectively. In overweight and obese women with PCOS, CANA and MET combination therapy may be similar to MET monotherapy in improving menstrual frequency, weight control, hyperandrogenemia, and relieving insulin resistance. CANA/MET may have more benefits in reducing TT, AUCGlu, and the AUCIns/AUCGlu ratio within three months than MET monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04973891.",

Direct actions targeting cellular pathways, particularly via AMP-activated protein kinase and through inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis, or systemic mechanisms involving insulin and insulin-like growth factors have been much studied in vitro and in preclinical models. Epidemiologic and retrospective studies also provide clinical evidence in support of metformin as an antitumor agent. Preoperative window-of-opportunity trials confirm the safety of metformin in women with primary breast cancer, and demonstrate reduction in tumor cell proliferation and complex pathways of gene suppression or overexpression attributable to metformin. Confirmation of insulin-mediated effects, independent of body mass index, also supports the potential benefit of adjuvant metformin therapy. Neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advanced disease trials combining metformin with established anticancer agents are under way or proposed. Companion biomarker studies will utilize in vitro and preclinical understanding of the relevant molecular pathways to, in future, refine patient and tumor selection for metformin therapy.",

Plasma samples were collected from five PCOS-IR patients of childbearing age before and after 3 months of metformin treatment, and the samples were sequenced. The diversity and taxonomic composition of different microbial communities were analyzed through full-length 16 S glycosomal RNA gene sequencing. After metformin treatment, fasting plasma glucose levels and IR degree of PCOS-IR patients were significantly improved. The 16 S analysis of plasma EVs from metformin-treated patients showed higher microbial diversity. There were significant differences in EVs derived from some environmental bacteria before and after metformin treatment. Notably, Streptococcus salivarius was more abundant in the metformin-treated group, suggesting it may be a potential probiotic. The study demonstrated changes in the microbial composition of plasma EVs before and after metformin treatment. The findings may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of PCOS-IR and provide new avenues for research.",

However, knowledge of the full effects of metformin on biochemical pathways and processes in its primary target tissue, the liver, is limited. One established effect of metformin is to decrease cellular energy levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) are key regulators of metabolism that are respectively activated and inhibited in acute response to cellular energy depletion. Here we show that metformin robustly inhibits mTORC1 in mouse liver tissue and primary hepatocytes. Using mouse genetics, we find that at the lowest concentrations of metformin that inhibit hepatic mTORC1 signaling, this inhibition is dependent on AMPK and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex (TSC complex). Finally, we show that metformin profoundly inhibits hepatocyte protein synthesis in a manner that is largely dependent on its ability to suppress mTORC1 signaling.",

      "abstract": "Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are a commonly underestimated pathology in terms of incidence and associated morbimortality. Currently, an appreciable subset of patients are resistant or poorly responsive to the main current medical treatments [i.e., synthetic somatostatin analogs (SSAs) and dopamine agonists]. Thus, development and optimization of novel and available medical therapies is necessary. Biguanides (metformin, buformin, and phenformin) are antidiabetic drugs that exert antitumoral actions in several tumor types, but their pharmacological effects on PitNETs are poorly known. We aimed to explore the direct effects of biguanides on key functions (cell viability, hormone release, apoptosis, and signaling pathways) in primary cell cultures from human PitNETs and cell lines. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of combined metformin with SSAs on cell viability and hormone secretion. A total of 13 corticotropinomas, 13 somatotropinomas, 13 nonfunctioning PitNETs, 3 prolactinomas, and 2 tumoral pituitary cell lines (AtT-20 and GH3) were used to evaluate the direct effects of biguanides on cell viability, hormone release, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. Biguanides reduced cell viability in all PitNETs and cell lines (with phenformin being the most effective biguanide) and increased apoptosis in somatotropinomas. Moreover, buformin and phenformin, but not metformin, reduced hormone secretion in a cell type-specific manner. Combination metformin/SSA therapy did not increase SSA monotherapy effectiveness. Effects of biguanides on PitNETs could involve the modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent ([Ca2+]i, PI3K/Akt) and independent (MAPK) mechanisms. Altogether, our data unveil clear antitumoral effects of biguanides on PitNET cells, opening avenues to explore their potential as drugs to treat these pathologies.",

PCOS is linked to higher levels of gremlin-1, a protein involved in ovarian follicle development, which may cause insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities. The objective is to evaluate the effects of metformin treatment on gremlin-1 levels in patients with PCOS. Sixty patients diagnosed with PCOs based on the Rotterdam criteria were selected as the PCOS group, while 30 healthy women matched for age were selected as the control group. The patients took metformin 850 mg twice daily and provided fasting blood samples before and after treatment. Data was collected through a questionnaire, direct interviewing, ultrasound examination, and laboratory examination, and analyzed using SPSS for Windows 7. The study found that PCOS patients had increased levels of gremlin compared to the control group. Additionally, PCOS patients had increased levels of blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. After taking metformin, patients showed a significant decrease in gremlin concentration. Treatment with metformin also resulted in a decrease in body mass index, blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Metformin decrease gremlin and insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrinologic and gynecologic disorder that affects women of reproductive age; besides, insulin resistance (IR) occurs in 50-70 % of PCOS cases. Metformin (Met) is commonly prescribed for IR management; however, it does not affect IR with some gastrointestinal symptoms. Spirulina platensis (SP) is a blue-green alga that may increase insulin sensitivity. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate SP as an alternative treatment to Met for improving glucose homeostasis by assessing the expression of 11 crucial genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway. After induction of the PCOS model using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (60 mg/kg bwt) for 30 consecutive days, rats were allocated into six groups. Relative liver weight, glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) serum levels, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and insulin were determined. Furthermore, the gene expression of Ins1, Irs1, Pik3ca, Prkcz, Foxo1, Srebf1, Ppargc1a, Pklr, Gk, G6pc, and Pepck in the rat's liver tissue was determined using qRT-PCR. Treatment of the PCOS control group with Met or SP revealed a decrease in all these parameters compared with the PCOS model. Additionally, we found a statistically significant difference in the expression of both the Gk and Prkcz genes. To summarize our study results, SP or Met supplementation to PCOS rats had almost the same effect on assessed relative liver weight, GOT, GPT, and insulin levels compared with PCOS control rats. If further studies confirm and detect more impact of SP on IR in PCOS, SP could be used instead of Met since the latter causes many side effects.",

A total of 64 overweight/obese women with PCOS diagnosed <i>via</i> the Rotterdam criteria were randomly assigned to metformin(MET) 850 mg twice a day(BID) or combined MET 850 mg BID with beinaglutide (COMB) starting at 0.1mg three times a day(TID)and increasing to 0.2mg TID two weeks later. The main endpoints were changes in anthropometric measurements of obesity. Glucose and lipid metabolic, gonadal profiles, and antral follicle count changes as secondary outcomes were also observed. 60(93.75%) patients completed the study. In terms of lowering weight, body mass index (BMI),waist circumference(WC) and waist to height ratio(WHtR), COMB treatment outperformed MET monotherapy. Subjects in the COMB arm lost weight 4.54±3.16kg compared with a 2.47±3.59kg loss in the MET arm. In the COMB group, BMI,WC and WHtR were reduced significantly compared with that in the MET group, respectively. COMB therapy is also more favorable in the reduction of fasting insulin(FINS), total testosterone(TT), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR) when compared to MET therapy. Antral follicle count and ovarian volume were non-significantly changed in both groups.The most frequent side effects in both groups were mild and moderate digestive symptoms. Itching and induration at the injection site were reported with COMB treatment. Short-term combined treatment with beinaglutide and metformin appears superior to metformin monotherapy in lowering body weight, BMI, WC,WHtR and improving insulin sensitivity and androgen excess in women with PCOS and obesity, with tolerable adverse events. https://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx, identifier ChiCTR2000033741.",

To explore the potential effects of swertiamarin, on abrupted insulin and steroidogenic signaling in human luteinized granulosa cells from PCOS patients with or without insulin resistance. hLGCs from 8 controls and 16 PCOS patients were classified for insulin resistance based on down regulation of protein expression of insulin receptor-β (INSR- β) as shown in our previous paper. Cells were grouped as control, PCOS-IR and PCOS-NIR, treated with swertiamarin (66 µM) and metformin (1 mM). Expression of key molecules involved in insulin signaling, fat metabolism, IGF system and steroidogenesis were compared between groups. Swertiamarin significantly (P < 0.05) reversed the expression of INSR-β, PI(3)K, p-Akt, PKC-ζ, PPARγ, (P < 0.01) IRS (Ser 307) and IGF system in PCOS-IR group and was equally potent to metformin. In the same group, candidate genes viz SREBP1c, FAS, ACC-1 and CPT-1 were down regulated by swertiamarin (P < 0.001) and metformin (P < 0.001). Significant upregulation was demonstrated in expression of StAR, CYP19A1, 17β-HSD and 3β-HSD when treated with swertiamarin (P < 0.01) and metformin (P < 0.01) in PCOS-IR followed by increase in 17β-HSD and 3β-HSD enzyme activity along with estradiol and progesterone secretions. However, swertiamarin did not reveal any effect on PCOS-NIR group as compared to metformin that significantly (P < 0.01) reversed all the parameters related to steroidogenesis and down regulated basal expression of insulin signaling genes. Swertiamarin, presents itself as a potential fertility drug in hLGCs from PCOS-IR patients.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), a toxic environment contaminant, induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated neuronal apoptosis and consequential neurodegenerative disorders. Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, has recently received a great attention owing to its protection against neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known regarding the effect of metformin on Cd-induced neurotoxicity. Here we show that metformin effectively prevented Cd-evoked apoptotic cell death in neuronal cells, by suppressing Cd activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), which was attributed to blocking Cd inactivation of protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibition of JNK with SP600125, knockdown of c-Jun, or overexpression of PP5 potentiated metformin's inhibitory effect on Cd-induced phosphorylation of JNK/c-Jun and apoptosis. Activation of AMPK with AICAR or ectopic expression of constitutively active AMPKα strengthened the inhibitory effects of metformin on Cd-induced phosphorylation of JNK/c-Jun and apoptosis, whereas expression of dominant negative AMPKα weakened these effects of metformin. Metformin repressed Cd-induced ROS, thereby diminishing cell death. N-acetyl-l-cysteine enhanced the inhibitory effects of metformin on Cd-induced ROS and apoptosis. Moreover, using Mito-TEMPO, we further demonstrated that metformin attenuated Cd-induced cell death by suppressing induction of mitochondrial ROS. Taken together, these results indicate that metformin prevents mitochondrial ROS inactivation of PP5 and AMPK, thus attenuating Cd-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in neuronal cells. Our data highlight that metformin may be a promising drug for prevention of Cd-induced oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of insulin sensitizer drugs in the treatment of PCOS. Research in recent years has shown that sitagliptin has been reported to improve ovarian cycles and ovulation in PCOS patients. We aimed to compare the effects of metformin and sitagliptin on PCOS individuals undergoing ICSI. Sixty PCOS patients were divided into 3 groups: metformin, sitagliptin, and placebo group. Treatment was carried out 2 months before the start of the ovulation cycle and continued until the day of oocyte aspiration. The serum levels of total testosterone, estradiol, and fasting insulin along with the total number of retrieved, normal and abnormal MII, and fertilized oocytes, the number of transferred embryos (grades I, II and III), and biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates as well as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were evaluated. There was a significant reduction in the serum levels of Insulin and total testosterone in the treated groups compared with the placebo. The number of mature and normal MII oocytes increased significantly in the treated groups compared with the placebo. Moreover, the number of immature oocytes decreased significantly and the number of grade I embryos increases significantly in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. We conclude that sitagliptin can improve the maturation of oocytes and embryos' quality more effectively than metformin, in PCOS patients undergoing ICSI.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the value of the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) as a judgment criterion for metformin pre-treatment before <i>in vitro</i> fertilization/intracellular sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) and embryo transfer (ET) for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. The clinical and laboratory information of PCOS patients who received IVF/ICSI-ET from January 2017 to September 2021 was retrospectively analyzed. We compared the clinical pregnancy rate (primary outcome) and controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)-related parameters (secondary outcomes) between patients with and without metformin pre-treatment for all PCOS patients not grouped by HOMA-IR, PCOS patients with HOMA-IR < 2.71, and PCOS patients with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.71. A total of 969 PCOS patients who received the GnRH-antagonist protocol were included in this study. For all PCOS patients, the metformin group showed comparable clinical pregnancy rates in fresh ET cycles and frozen ET cycles compared with the control group (55.9% vs. 57.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.821 and 63.8% vs. 60.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.497). For PCOS patients with HOMA-IR < 2.71, the clinical pregnancy rates in both fresh ET cycles and frozen ET cycles were statistically similar between the two groups (61.5% vs. 57.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.658 and 70.6% vs. 66.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.535). For PCOS patients with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.71, the clinical pregnancy rate in fresh ET cycles was comparable between the two groups (51.5% vs. 56.3, <i>p</i> = 0.590), but it was statistically higher in the metformin group than in the control group in frozen ET cycles (57.1% vs. 40.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.023). The metformin group had less oocytes retrieved, a lower cleaved oocyte rate, a lower available D3 embryo rate, a lower blastocyst formation rate, and a lower available blastocyst rate than the control group. HOMA-IR is a judgment criterion for metformin pre-treatment before IVF/ICSI-ET in patients with PCOS. Metformin pre-treatment could be added for PCOS patients with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.71 during frozen IVF/ICSI-ET cycles to improve the clinical pregnancy rate.",

We therefore investigated whether glucose concentrations influence STAT3 expression in type 1 endometrial cancer, and whether such STAT3 expression might be inhibited by metformin. In Ishikawa (grade 1) endometrial cancer cells subjected to media with low, normal, or high concentrations of glucose, expression of STAT3 and its target proteins was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ishikawa cells were treated with metformin and assessed with cell proliferation, survival, migration, and ubiquitin assays, as well as Western blot and qPCR. Expression of apoptosis proteins was evaluated with Western blot in Ishikawa cells transfected with a STAT3 overexpression plasmid and treated with metformin. A xenograft tumor model was used for studying the in vivo efficacy of metformin. Expression of STAT3 and its target proteins was increased in Ishikawa cells cultured in high glucose media. In vitro, metformin inhibited cell proliferation, survival and migration but induced apoptosis. Metformin reduced expression levels of pSTAT3 ser727, total STAT3, and its associated cell survival and anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, metformin treatment was associated with increased degradation of pSTAT3 ser727. No change in apoptotic protein expression was noticed with STAT3 overexpression in Ishikawa cells. In vivo, metformin treatment led to a decrease in tumor weight as well as reductions of STAT3, pSTAT3 ser727, its target proteins. These results suggest that STAT3 expression in type 1 endometrial cancer is stimulated by a high glucose environment and inhibited by metformin.",

      "abstract": "High levels of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 have been frequently reported in different human cancers, playing a major role in drug resistance and regulation of cancer cell redox homeostasis. Metformin (MET), a drug widely used for type 2 diabetes, has recently gained interest for treating several cancers. Recent studies indicated that the anti-proliferative effects of metformin in cancer cells are highly dependent on glucose concentration. The present work was directed to determine whether use of a specific inhibitor of HO-1 activity, alone or in combination with metformin, affected metastatic prostate cancer cell viability under different concentrations of glucose. MTT assay and the xCELLigence system were used to evaluate cell viability and cell proliferation in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. Cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species were analyzed by flow cytometry. The activity of HO-1 was inhibited using a selective imidazole-based inhibitor; genes associated with antioxidant systems and cell death were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Our study demonstrates that metformin suppressed prostate cancer growth in vitro and increased oxidative stress. Disrupting the antioxidant HO-1 activity, especially under low glucose concentration, could be an attractive approach to potentiate metformin antineoplastic effects and could provide a biochemical basis for developing HO-1-targeting drugs against solid tumors.",

      "abstract": "Metformin increased cellular ROS levels in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, with minimal effect in HDF, human primary dermal fibroblasts. Metformin reduced cellular ATP levels in HDF, but not in AsPC-1 cells. Metformin increased AMPK, p-AMPK (Thr172), FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a (Ser413), and MnSOD levels in HDF, but not in AsPC-1 cells. p-AMPK and p-FOXO3a also translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus by metformin in HDF, but not in AsPC-1 cells. Transfection of si-FOXO3a in HDF increased ROS levels, while wt-FOXO3a-transfected AsPC-1 cells decreased ROS levels. Metformin combined with apigenin increased ROS levels dramatically and decreased cell viability in various cancer cells including AsPC-1 cells, with each drug used singly having a minimal effect. Metformin/apigenin combination synergistically decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in AsPC-1 cells but to a lesser extent in HDF cells. Metformin/apigenin combination in AsPC-1 cells increased DNA damage-, apoptosis-, autophagy- and necroptosis-related factors, but not in HDF cells. Oral administration with metformin/apigenin caused dramatic blocks tumor size in AsPC-1-xenografted nude mice. Our results suggest that metformin in cancer cells differentially regulates cellular ROS levels via AMPK-FOXO3a-MnSOD pathway and combination of metformin/apigenin exerts anticancer activity through DNA damage-induced apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis by cancer cell-specific ROS amplification.",

The effect of glucose metabolism on γδ T cells and their impact on tumor surveillance remain unknown. Here, we showed that high glucose induced Warburg effect type of bioenergetic profile in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, leading to excessive lactate accumulation, which further inhibited lytic granule secretion by impairing the trafficking of cytolytic machinery to the Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell-tumor synapse by suppressing AMPK activation and resulted in the loss of antitumor activity in vitro, in vivo and in patients. Strikingly, activating the AMPK pathway through glucose control or metformin treatment reversed the metabolic abnormalities and restored the antitumor activity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. These results suggest that the impaired antitumor activity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells induced by dysregulated glucose metabolism may contribute to the increased cancer risk in T2DM patients and that metabolic reprogramming by targeting the AMPK pathway with metformin may improve tumor immunosurveillance.",

In this study, Microscopic and FACS analyses showed that metformin induced cancer cell⁻cell adhesion exemplified by cell aggregation and anoikis under glucose restriction. Furthermore, western blot and QPCR analyses revealed that metformin dramatically upregulated integrin β1 expression. Silencing of integrin β1 significantly disrupted cell aggregation and reduced anoikis induced by metformin. Moreover, we showed that p53 family member ΔNp63α transcriptionally suppressed integrin β1 expression and is responsible for metformin-mediated upregulation of integrin β1. In summary, this study reveals a novel mechanism for metformin anticancer activity and demonstrates that cell⁻cell adhesion mediated by integrin β1 plays a critical role in metformin-induced anoikis.",

A single-centre, prospective, randomized open-label (ratio 1:1) noninferiority trial was conducted at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, between July 2019 and April 2021. Women aged 18 to 45 years with PCOS and IR were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 100 mg (n = 33) canagliflozin daily or 1500 to 2000 mg metformin daily (n = 35) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric measurements, menstrual frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic variables and body fat distribution. For lowering of HOMA-IR after 12 weeks of treatment, canagliflozin was found to be noninferior to metformin (least-squares mean difference -0.81% [95% confidence interval -2.13 to 0.51]). Both canagliflozin and metformin significantly improved menstrual pattern, reduced body weight and total fat mass, and decreased triglyceride levels. Compared with metformin, canagliflozin had significant advantages in reducing uric acid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels. Pruritus vulvae (9.09%) and gastrointestinal reaction (55.55%) were the main adverse events in the metformin group and canagliflozin group, respectively. This study demonstrates that canagliflozin was not inferior to metformin in PCOS patients with IR, which suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors should be considered as effective drugs in the treatment of PCOS patients with IR.",

One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial. Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 microg ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 microg EE/100 microg levonorgestrel + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome measures were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function. All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance. In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a first-line drug for treating type 2 diabetes and has gained considerable interest as a potential anticancer agent. Increasing evidence suggests that metformin antagonizes diabetes and tumors through disrupting metabolic homeostasis and altering energy state. However, whether AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to such effects of metformin remains controversial. We performed integrative metabolomics analyses to systematically examine the effects of metformin on metabolic pathways in Prkaa1 wild type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells as well as human cells based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Metformin treatment induced metabolic reprogramming and reduced the energy state of both Prkaa1 WT and KO MEF cells, as evidenced by suppressed tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, elevated lactate production as well as decreased NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. Additionally, metabolic flux analysis also showed that metformin Ampkα-independently increased metabolic flux from glucose to lactate and decreased metabolic flux from acetyl-CoA to TCA cycle as well as from pyruvate to malate. Moreover, metformin Ampkα-dependently upregulated P-Acc but Ampkα-independently inhibited the levels of P-mTor, P-S6, Lc3, Atgl and P-Erk in MEF cells. Similarly, we demonstrated that a commonly used AMPK agonist 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) starvation, as a common model for energy stress, both led to Ampkα-independent metabolism alterations in MEF cells. Furthermore, these effects of metformin were also confirmed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells as well as in MCF10A shControl and shPRKAA1 cells. Importantly, we found that metformin could obviously inhibit colony conformation of HCC cells in an Ampkα-independent manner. Our data highlight a comprehensive view of metabolic reprogramming mediated by metformin as well as AICAR. These observations suggest that metformin could affect cellular metabolism largely bypassing Ampkα, and may provide a new insight for its clinical usage.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting hepatic glucose production through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Autophagy is closely related to the homeostasis and stress mechanisms of the body. In recent years, much research has arisen on therapeutic methods utilizing autophagy mechanisms to treat diagnoses such as metabolic diseases, tumors, and Alzheimer's disease. This study thus aimed to investigate the effects of metformin treatment on the differentiation of osteoclasts and changes in AMPK mechanisms, which play an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, and mTOR, a highly conserved kinase that regulates autophagy. Experimentation, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRAP) staining, pit formation assay, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to investigate the effects of metformin on osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, to investigate its association with AMPK and pathways, the AMPK inhibitor compound C and mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) activator leucine were used to examine the expression of osteoclast- or autophagy-related proteins, genes, and TRAP-positive cells. Metformin showed no cytotoxic effects on mouse osteoblastic cell lines (MC3T3-E1) and murine macrophage cell lines (RAW264.7) but did inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, metformin was found to inhibit osteoclast differentiation through AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition. In turn, AMPK inhibition using compound C promoted osteoclast differentiation, and mTOR activation using leucine inhibited autophagy and osteoclast differentiation. Metformin activates the AMPK pathway while functioning as an activator of mTOR, thereby leading to the inhibition of autophagy and osteoclast differentiation.",

Both berberine and metformin have been shown to improve PCOS, but whether the combination of berberine and metformin can better improve PCOS by inhibiting autophagy remains unclear. PCOS models were constructed by injecting dehydroepiandrosterone into rats, and berberine, metformin or berberine combined with metformin was administered to rats after modeling. Rats' body weight and ovarian weight were measured before and after modeling. Histopathological examination of ovarian tissue and estrous cycle analysis of rats were performed. Insulin resistance, hormone levels, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism in PCOS rats were assessed. Expression of the AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathway and autophagy-related proteins was analyzed by Western blot assays. Granulosa cells were isolated from rat ovarian tissue and identified by immunofluorescence staining followed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. Berberine combined with metformin reduced the body weight and ovarian weight of PCOS rats, increased the number of primordial and primary follicles, decreased the number of secondary and atretic follicles, normalized the estrous cycle, and improved insulin resistance, androgen biosynthesis, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorders, and increased estrogen production. In addition, berberine combined with metformin reduced the number of autophagosomes in granulosa cells, which may be related to AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathway activation, decreased Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I levels, and increased p62 expression. Berberine combined with metformin could inhibit autophagy by activating the AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathway in PCOS, indicating that berberine combined with metformin is a potential treatment strategy for PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with a prevalence of up to 7%, is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. It is a complex metabolic-endocrine disorder with severe long-term health consequences, such as a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. According to prospective studies, women with PCOS have abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus in 31.0-35.0% and 7.5-10.0% respectively. This risk is 2-3 times higher than normal. Insulin resistance plays a key role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome, and this makes the use of oral antidiabetic drugs most compelling. The majority of studies have shown amelioration of typical symptoms such as hyperandrogenism and cycle irregularities following the use of oral anti-diabetics, and ovulation and pregnancy rates increased. Furthermore, these drugs might be cardioprotective by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the risk for type 2 diabetes. The best-investigated drug is metformin. Metformin is not approved for PCOS treatment in Germany and is a class B drug in pregnancy. In sterile PCOS patients, clomiphene citrate is still the first choice. The combination of clomiphene with metformin and lifestyle changes such as weight reduction and exercise might be superior to clomiphene alone. This article covers the use of different oral anti-diabetic drugs in the treatment of PCOS, and their influence on fertility and long-term health.",

Metformin (MET) has been shown to suppress the proliferative capacity and invasion ability of GBM cells by activating AMPK and inhibiting mTOR, but the effective dose exceeded the maximum tolerated dose. Artesunate (ART) can exert certain anti-tumour effects by activating the AMPK-mTOR axis and inducing autophagy in tumour cells. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of MET combined with ART combination therapy on autophagy and apoptosis in GBM cells. MET combined with ART treatment effectively suppressed the viability, mono-cloning ability, migration and invasion capacities, as well as metastatic ability of GBM cells. The underlying mechanism involved modulation of the ROS-AMPK-mTOR axis, which was confirmed using 3-methyladenine and rapamycin to inhibit or promote the effects of MET combined with ART, respectively. The study findings suggest that MET used in combination with ART can induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis in GBM cells by activating the ROS-AMPK-mTOR pathway, providing a potential new treatment for GBM.",

      "abstract": "The biguanide drug metformin is widely used in type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy, due to its ability to decrease serum glucose levels, mainly by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. A considerable number of studies have shown that metformin, besides its antidiabetic action, can improve other disease states, such as polycystic ovary disease, acute kidney injury, neurological disorders, cognitive impairment and renal damage. In addition, metformin is well known to suppress the growth and progression of different types of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, several epidemiological studies suggest that metformin is capable of lowering cancer risk and reducing the rate of cancer deaths among diabetic patients. The antitumoral effects of metformin have been proposed to be mainly mediated by the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, a number of signaling pathways, both dependent and independent of AMPK activation, have been reported to be involved in metformin antitumoral action. Among these, the Wingless and Int signaling pathway have recently been included. Here, we will focus our attention on the main molecular mechanisms involved.",

However, the molecular mechanisms behind its impact on lipid metabolism remain partially explored and understood. In the current study, mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling was used to investigate the lipidomic changes in the serum of 26 healthy individuals after a single-dose intake of metformin. Samples were analyzed at five-time points: preadministration, before the maximum concentration of metformin (Cmax), Cmax, after Cmax, and 36 h post-administration. A total of 762 molecules were significantly altered between the five-time points. Based on a comparison between baseline level and Cmax, metformin significantly increased and decreased the level of 33 and 192 lipids, respectively (FDR ≤ 0.05 and fold change cutoff of 1.5). The altered lipids are mainly involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, several lipids acted in an opposed or similar manner to metformin levels and included fatty acyls, sterol lipids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids. The significantly altered lipid species pointed to fundamental lipid signaling pathways that could be linked to the pleiotropic effects of metformin in T2DM, insulin resistance, polycystic ovary syndrome, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.",

It has been shown that curcumin also exhibits insulin-sensitizing properties. Given that metformin acts as an ovulation inducing agent and both curcumin and metformin can reduce insulin resistance, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of metformin with and without curcumin nanomicelles in the treatment of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This clinical trial was conducted on 100 women with PCOS, diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria, who were sequentially recruited and randomly divided into two groups (n = 50 each). Group 1 received 500 mg metformin three times daily and group 2 received 80 mg/day capsule of curcumin nanomicelle and 500 mg metformin three times a day for 3 months. After collecting fasting blood samples, biochemical parameters including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, plasma glucose, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were evaluated based on enzymatic methods. Hormonal parameters were assessed using immunoassay kits. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were also assessed. After treatment, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and total testosterone in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (p < 0.05). Post-treatment LDL-C levels in groups 1 and 2 were 117.9 ± 24 and 91.12 ± 19.46 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, HDL-C levels were increased with curcumin (group 1: 38.1 ± 4.36 mg/dL; group 2: 44.12 ± 7.3 mg/dL, p < 0.05). Total cholesterol was decreased with curcumin level (group 1: 207.9 ± 39.84 mg/dL; group 2; 159.7 ± 48.43 mg/dL, p < 0.05), with a decrease in triglycerides levels (group 1: 141.6 ± 9.57; group 2: 97.5 ± 8.8 mg/dL, p < 0.01).

      "abstract": "Dysregulation in histone acetylation, a significant epigenetic alteration closely associated with major pathologies including cancer, promotes tumorigenesis, inactivating tumor-suppressor genes and activating oncogenic pathways. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that regulates a multitude of biological processes. Although a number of studies have identified the mechanisms by which AMPK regulates cancer growth, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain unknown. The impact of metformin, an AMPK activator, on cervical cancer was evaluated through assessments of cell viability, tumor xenograft model, pan-acetylation analysis, and the role of the AMPK-PCAF-H3K9ac signaling pathway. Using label-free quantitative acetylproteomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP) technology, the activation of AMPK-induced H3K9 acetylation was further investigated. In this study, we found that metformin, acting as an AMPK agonist, activates AMPK, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cervical cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, AMPK activation induces H3K9 acetylation at epigenetic level, leading to chromatin remodeling in cervical cancer. This also enhances the binding of H3K9ac to the promoter regions of multiple tumor suppressor genes, thereby promoting their transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the absence of PCAF renders AMPK activation incapable of inducing H3K9 acetylation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AMPK mediates the inhibition of cervical cancer growth through PCAF-dependent H3K9 acetylation. This discovery not only facilitates the clinical application of metformin but also underscores the essential role of PCAF in AMPK activation-induced H3K9 hyperacetylation.",

Less is known about inflammation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Thus we evaluated the impact of PCOS on circulating cytokine levels and the effects of anti-diabetic therapies on insulin action, cytokine and chemokine levels and inflammatory signaling in skeletal muscle. Twenty subjects with PCOS and 12 healthy normal cycling (NC) subjects of similar body mass index were studied. PCOS subjects received oral placebo or pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, for 6 months. All PCOS subjects then had metformin, 2 g/day, added to their treatment. Circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines, and adiponectin, skeletal muscle markers of inflammation and phosphorylation of signaling proteins, insulin action evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp procedure and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance were measured. Circulating levels of a number of cytokines and chemokines were generally similar between PCOS and NC subjects. Levels in PCOS subjects were not altered by pioglitazone or metformin treatment, even though whole body insulin action and adiponectin levels increased with pioglitazone. In spite of the lack of change in levels of cytokines and chemokines, several markers of inflammation in skeletal muscle were improved with Pio treatment. PCOS may represent a state of elevated sensitivity of inflammatory cells in skeletal muscle to cytokines and chemokines, a property that could be reversed by pioglitazone treatment together with improved insulin action.",

Forty-two infertile women with PCOS were selected in this randomized clinical study. Basal steroid and gonadotropin levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The patients were randomly divided into group 1 (n = 21) and group 2 (n = 21). Group 1 patients were treated with laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). Group 2 patients underwent laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) and received 1700 mg per day of metformin for 6 months. LOD was performed in women with PCOS using a unipolar electrode. Serum progesterone (P) level > 5 ng/mL was considered as a confirmation of ovulation. Ovulation and pregnancy rates were determined after six cycles. Serum androgens and insulin response to OGTT decreased significantly after metformin therapy. Mean serum P levels and endometrial thickness were significantly higher in cycles treated with metformin plus LOD (34.6 +/- 25.4 ng/mL, 8.4 +/- 1.1 mm) than in those treated with LOD alone (26.2 +/- 24.7 ng/mL, 7.9 +/- 2.8 mm) (P < 0.05). The ovulation (56 of 65 cycles, 86.1% vs 29 of 65 cycles, 44.6%) and pregnancy rates (nine of 21 women, 47.6% vs four of 21 women, 19.1%) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group I. Metformin improves insulin resistance, reduces androgen levels and significantly increases the ovulation and pregnancy rates in infertile women, following LOD.",

Pilot studies suggests that acupuncture treatment with combined manual and low-frequency electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture (EA)) of the needles decrease circulating glycated haemoglobulin (HbA1c) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Therefore, we here aim to investigate if acupuncture treatment or metformin together with lifestyle or lifestyle management alone improves insulin sensitivity and related symptoms in overweight/obese women with PCOS. This is a two-centre multinational (Sweden and China), cross-sectional case-control study combined with an open-labelled randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants are randomised to one of three groups: (1) EA 2-3 times/week during 4 months+lifestyle management; (2) metformin, 500 mg, three/day during 4 months+lifestyle management; or (3) lifestyle management alone. The primary outcome measure in the RCT is changes in HbA1C. A total of 123 obese overweight women with PCOS will be enrolled and randomised into one of the three groups with a target power of at least 80% and 5% significance level based on two-sided tests. The study has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Stockholm and of Peking University Third Hospital, China. Primary outcome data of the RCT will be published in a relevant journal together with supporting secondary outcome measurements. Further, outcome measurements will be published in separate papers as well as case-control data. We anticipate that EA and metformin, both with lifestyle management, are equally effective and superior to lifestyle management alone for improvement of glycaemic control.

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disease in women. Insulin resistance (IR) has emerged as a central contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), kidney deficiency is the main syndrome of PCOS. The deficiency of the kidney cannot vaporize water-dampness, and the retention of water-dampness accumulates into phlegm dampness stagnation, resulting in visceral dysfunction and metabolic disorder. TCM involving syndrome differentiation and treatment is widely used to adjust women's menstrual cycles. Our patented formula Bushen Huatan Decoction (BSHTD) has been proven to be effective in the clinical treatment of IR-PCOS. Baduanjin also plays an important role in improving metabolic syndrome through lifestyle intervention. This study investigates the clinical efficacy of Bushen Huatan Decoction combined with Baduanjin in IR-PCOS, to form a specific TCM-behaviour intervention plan in the treatment of IR-PCOS. This is a randomized controlled trial involving 190 participants diagnosed with IR-PCOS. All participants will be randomly allocated into 5 groups: group A will receive metformin; group B, BSHTD; group C, Baduanjin; group D, BSHTD combined with metformin; and group E, BSHTD combined with Baduanjin. One course of treatment lasts 3 months, a total of two courses. The primary outcomes are changes in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvements in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin-releasing test (INS). The secondary outcomes are improvements in the menstrual cycle, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, basic serum sex hormone levels, free androgen index (FAI), Ferriman-Gallwey scores, body mass index (BMI) and TCM syndrome scores. The related observation indexes will be collected at baseline, during the process of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. Simultaneously, close monitoring of possible adverse events will be performed throughout the trial process. This trial will investigate the efficacy of the comprehensive intervention program of Bushen Huatan Decoction combined with Baduanjin on the adjustment of the menstrual cycle, improvement of insulin resistance and correction of glucose metabolism disorder in IR-PCOS patients. It is expected to form an alternative treatment of TCM-behaviour intervention therapy for IR-PCOS and promote the Chinese fitness Qigong Baduanjin in the application of lifestyle diseases.

Metformin is thought to inhibit the mTOR pathway through upstream activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suggesting combination therapy may enhance antitumor activity of sapanisertib. We report preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy from the dose-escalation study of sapanisertib in combination with metformin in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors resistant or refractory to standard treatment, with and without mTOR/AKT/PI3K pathway alterations, received sapanisertib 3 or 4 mg daily together with metformin once to three times daily (500-1,500 mg). All patients underwent 14-day titration period for metformin in cycle 1. Tumor measurements were performed following cycle 2 and subsequently every 8 weeks. A total of 30 patients were enrolled across four cohorts (3 mg/500 mg; 3 mg/1,000 mg, 4 mg/1,000 mg; 4 mg/1,500 mg). 19 were female (63%), median age was 57 (range: 30-77), all were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1. Tumor types included sarcoma (6), breast (4), ovarian (4), head and neck (3), colorectal (2), lung (2), renal cell (2), endometrial (2), gastroesophageal junction (1), prostate (1), stomach (1), urachus (1), and cervical cancer (1). Median number of prior lines of therapy was 4. Most common genomic alterations included PIK3CA (27%), PTEN (17%), AKT1/2 (10%), mTOR (10%). Of 30 patients evaluable for response, 4 patients achieved partial response (PR); 15 patients achieved stable disease (SD) as best response. Disease control rate (PR+SD) was 63%. Of the responders in PR, 3 of 4 patients had documented PTEN mutations (3/5 patients enrolled with PTEN mutations had PR); 2 of 4 of patients in PR had comutations (patient with leiomyosarcoma had both PTEN and TSC; patient with breast cancer had both PTEN and STK11); 1 of 4 patients in PR had AKT and mTOR mutation; tumor types included leiomyosarcoma (n = 2), breast (n = 1), and endometrial cancer (n = 1). Most common treatment-emergent adverse events included nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, and rash. Grade (G) 3-5 treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (4/30; 13%), fatigue (2/30; 7%), hypertriglyceridemia (1/30; 3%), rash (2/20; 7%), diarrhea (2/30; 7%), creatinine increase (1/30; 3%), acidosis (1/30; 3%). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were reported in the 3 mg/500 mg cohort. One of 6 patient had DLT in the 3 mg/1,000 mg cohort (G3 diarrhea) and 2 of 11 patients had DLTs in the 4 mg/1,500 mg cohort (G3 fatigue, G3 rash). 4 mg/1,000 mg was defined as the MTD. The safety profile of mTORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib in combination with metformin was generally tolerable, with antitumor activity observed in patients with advanced malignancies harboring PTEN mutations and AKT/mTOR pathway alterations. Sapanisertib (CB-228/TAK-228) is a potent, selective ATP-competitive, next-generation dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2. Metformin is thought to inhibit the mTOR pathway through upstream activation of AMPK suggesting combination therapy may enhance antitumor activity of sapanisertib. This dose-escalation study of sapanisertib and metformin in advanced solid tumors and mTOR/AKT/PI3K pathway alterations, demonstrates safety, tolerability, and early clinical activity in advanced malignancies harboring PTEN mutations and AKT/mTOR pathway alterations.Clinical trial information: NCT03017833.",

      "abstract": "Aspirin, the pro-drug of salicylate, is associated with reduced incidence of death from cancers of the colon, lung and prostate and is commonly prescribed in combination with metformin in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Salicylate activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by binding at the A-769662 drug binding site on the AMPK β1-subunit, a mechanism that is distinct from metformin which disrupts the adenylate charge of the cell. A hallmark of many cancers is high rates of fatty acid synthesis and AMPK inhibits this pathway through phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). It is currently unknown whether targeting the AMPK-ACC-lipogenic pathway using salicylate and/or metformin may be effective for inhibiting cancer cell survival. Salicylate suppresses clonogenic survival of prostate and lung cancer cells at therapeutic concentrations achievable following the ingestion of aspirin (<1.0 mM); effects not observed in prostate (PNT1A) and lung (MRC-5) epithelial cell lines. Salicylate concentrations of 1 mM increased the phosphorylation of ACC and suppressed de novo lipogenesis and these effects were enhanced with the addition of clinical concentrations of metformin (100 μM) and eliminated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in AMPK β1. Supplementation of media with fatty acids and/or cholesterol reverses the suppressive effects of salicylate and metformin on cell survival indicating the inhibition of de novo lipogenesis is probably important. Pre-clinical studies evaluating the use of salicylate based drugs alone and in combination with metformin to inhibit de novo lipogenesis and the survival of prostate and lung cancers are warranted.",

Metformin was originally shown to lower testosterone levels in women with PCOS in the 1990s, an effect presumably related to its insulin sensitising actions. However, the precise mechanisms of metformin action in PCOS remain unclear and there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical response to this therapy in women with PCOS. Recent evidence indicates that genetic factors may play a significant role in predicting response to metformin therapy in PCOS and future studies are needed to further identify women who are most likely to benefit from this therapy. At present, there is no clear evidence to support broad metformin use in PCOS. Well-designed prospective trials are needed to establish clear benefit for metformin use in the treatment of the reproductive and metabolic consequences associated with PCOS.",

This trial was conducted in 19 adolescents (age ≤18 years) and 25 adult (age >18 years) women with PCOS. Anthropometric and measurements including, serum glucose, endocrine panel, and lipid profile were performed at baseline. IR was measured by Homeostasis Model Assessment IR (HOMA-IR). Anxiety and depression were measured by Beck's Anxiety (BAI) and Depression Inventories (BDI-II). All tests were repeated after a 90-day treatment with metformin (1,500 mg/day). The severity of depression and anxiety decreased after 90-day treatment with metformin in women diagnosed with PCOS. The BAI scores were higher in adolescent group while BDI-II scores were higher in the adult group (p = .016). After 90-day metformin treatment, both BDI-II and BAI scores were decreased by 3.3 and 3.4, respectively (p < .001). Indicators of IR and obesity were improved with this therapy. Although the adolescents weighed lower than the adults, baseline HOMA-IR 5.5 ± 1.7 was higher in this group than 4.4 ± 1.2 in the adult women (p =.022). The findings suggest that metformin decrease IR and improve mood both in adolescent and adult women with PCOS.",

Metformin may also benefit future health by modulating increased metabolic stress during pregnancy. To investigate whether metformin during pregnancy modified future metabolic health in women with PCOS. Follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial that compared metformin with placebo in women with PCOS. Mean follow-up period was 7.7 years (range, 5 to 11 years). Three university hospitals, seven local hospitals, and one gynecological specialist practice. Women with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria; all former participants in the Metformin in Pregnant PCOS Women Study. Metformin 2000 mg daily or placebo from first trimester to delivery in the original study. No intervention in the present follow-up study. Main outcome measure was weight gain in the follow-up period. Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure (BP) were registered. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and fasting lipids, glucose, and insulin were analyzed. Of 239 invited women, 131 (55%) participated in the follow-up. Weight gain was similar in women given metformin (2.1 ± 10.5 kg) and women given placebo (1.8 ± 11.2 kg) at 7.7 years' follow-up after pregnancy (P = 0.834). No difference was found in BMI, waist/hip ratio, BP, body composition, lipids, glucose and insulin levels, or prevalence of metabolic syndrome at follow-up between those treated with metformin and those treated with placebo during pregnancy. Metformin treatment during pregnancy did not influence the metabolic profile in women with PCOS at 7.7 years of follow-up.",

Metformin therapy reduces whole-body insulin resistance (IR) in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

We treated 16 women with PCOS and IR with metformin, and measured coronary flow reserve (CFR) at the beginning and after 6 months of metformin therapy using transthoracic second-harmonic Doppler echocardiography. At the end of the 6 months of metformin therapy, baseline coronary diastolic peak flow velocity (DPFV) did not change significantly (from 24.6 +/- 4.3 to 23.0 +/- 3.1, P = 0.106); however, hyperaemic coronary DPFV (from 68.2 +/- 12.7 to 74.5 +/- 9.7, P = 0.08), and CFR (from 2.75 +/- 0.48 to 3.3 +/- 0.5, P = 0.016) was significantly improved by metformin therapy.

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence demonstrates that targeting energy metabolism is a promising strategy to fight cancer. Here we show that combining metformin and short-term starvation markedly impairs metabolism and growth of colon and breast cancer. The impairment in glycolytic flux caused by starvation is enhanced by metformin through its interference with hexokinase II activity, as documented by measurement of 18F-fluorodeoxyglycose uptake. Oxidative phosphorylation is additively compromised by combined treatment: metformin virtually abolishes Complex I function; starvation determines an uncoupled status of OXPHOS and amplifies the activity of respiratory Complexes II and IV thus combining a massive ATP depletion with a significant increase in reactive oxygen species. More importantly, the combined treatment profoundly impairs cancer glucose metabolism and virtually abolishes lesion growth in experimental models of breast and colon carcinoma. Our results strongly suggest that energy metabolism is a promising target to reduce cancer progression.",

We investigated the efficacy of combined treatment with TMZ and metformin using cell viability and apoptosis assays. A GBM orthotopic mice model was established by inoculation of 5×105 U87 cells and treatedwith metformin, TMZ, and the combination for 4weeks. Western blotting and immunofluorescence of tumor specimens were analyzed to investigate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT pathway. The combination of TMZ and metformin showed higher cytotoxicity than single agents in U87, U251, and A172 cell lines. A combination of high-dose metformin and TMZ showed the highest apoptotic activity. The combination of TMZ and metformin enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylation, and p53 expression. The median survival of each group was 43.6, 55.2, 53.2, 65.2, and 71.3 days for control, metformin treatment (2 mg/25 g/day or 10 mg/25 g/day), TMZ treatment (15 mg/kg/day), combination treatment with low-dose metformin and TMZ, and combination treatment with high-dose metformin and TMZ, respectively. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) was significantly decreased in tumor specimens treated with metformin and TMZ. The combination of metformin and TMZ was superior to monotherapy using metformin or TMZ in terms of cell viability in vitro and survival in vivo. The combination of high-dose metformin and TMZ inhibited FASN expression in an orthotopic model. Inhibition of FASN might be a potential therapeutic target of GBM.",

Although recent studies have suggested that MANF appeared to be associated with insulin resistance, the results have been inconsistent. The aim of our study was to determine the serum MANF levels in women with PCOS and controls, to investigate their relationship to insulin resistance, and to evaluate circulating MANF changes with metformin intervention in PCOS women. We conducted a series of cross-sectional and interventional studies in 90 newly diagnosed patients with PCOS and 60 age- and gender-matched controls. Oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed to assess the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Forty-three women with PCOS were randomly assigned to six months of oral metformin therapy. Serum MANF levels were significantly lower in women with PCOS than in controls. Serum MANF levels were positively correlated with M-value and negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (FAT), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and free androgen index (FAI). Multivariate stepwise regression demonstrated that serum MANF levels were independently associated with M-value and FAI. After six months of metformin treatment, there was a significant increase in serum MANF levels in PCOS women. Serum MANF levels are decreased in women with PCOS, and are reversely related to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Metformin treatment elevates serum MANF levels and alleviates insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in PCOS women.",

Genetic studies in humans have suggested an important role for interleukin 1β (IL1β) in cancer pathogenesis. Direct evidence that IL1β contributes to the development of colon cancer has not yet been fully confirmed and no previous studies have evaluated how IL1β may interact with AD and/or Met to regulate malignant potential and intracellular signaling pathways in human and mouse colon cancer cells. We conducted in vitro studies using human (LoVo) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines to evaluate whether AD and Met alone or in combination may antagonize IL1β-regulated malignant potential in human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. IL1β increased malignant potential and regulated the expression of tumor suppressor (p53) and cell cycle regulatory genes (p21, p27, and cyclin E2) in human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. These effects were reversed by co-administration of AD and/or Met and were additively altered by AD and Met in combination in a STAT3- and AMPK/LKB1-dependent manner. We also observed using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis that IL1β-regulated cell cycle progression is altered by AD and Met alone or in combination. Our novel mechanistic studies provide evidence for an important role for IL1β in colon cancer and suggest that AD and/or Met might be useful agents in the management or chemoprevention of IL1β-induced colon carcinogenesis.",

Metformin, a biguanide medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been observed to be associated with longevity; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation are still unknown. The effects of metformin and high glucose, which have important roles in aging-related disease such as diabetes and cancer, were studied in lin-35 worms because they are associated with cancer-associated pRb function in mammals and have a tumour suppressor property. According to our results, the negative effect of high glucose on egg production of lin-35 worms was greater than that of N2 worms. High glucose shortened lifespan and increased body length and width in individuals of both strains. Metformin treatment alone extended the lifespan of N2 and lin-35 worms by reducing fertilization efficiency. However, when metformin was administered in the presence of high glucose, the lifespan of lin-35 worms was clearly longer compared to N2 worms. Additionally, we conclude that glucose and metformin in lin35 worms can extend life expectancy through a DAF-16/FOXO-independent mechanism. Furthermore, the results of this study will provide a new perspective on extending mammalian lifespan through the model organism <i>C. elegans</i>.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is an important first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and acts by increasing the body's ability to dispose of glucose. Metformin's efficacy can be affected by genetic variants in the transporters that regulate its uptake into cells. The SLC22A3 gene (also known as EMT; EMTH; OCT3) codes for organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), which is a broad-specificity cation transporter that also transports metformin. Most SLC22A3 variants reduce the rate of metformin transport but the rs8187715 variant (p.Thr44Met) is reported to increase uptake of metformin in vitro. However, the impact of this on in vivo metformin transport and efficacy is unknown. Very few carriers of this variant have been reported globally, but, notably, all were of Pacific Island descent. Therefore, this study aims to understand the prevalence of this variant in Polynesian peoples (Māori and Pacific peoples) and to understand its impact on metformin transport and efficacy in vivo. rs8187715 was genotyped in 310 individuals with Māori and Pacific ancestry recruited in Aotearoa New Zealand. To study this variant in a physiological context, an orthologous knockin mouse model with C57BL/6J background was used. Pharmacokinetic analysis compared uptake rate of metformin into tissues. Plasma growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) was also measured as a marker of metformin efficacy. Glucose and insulin tolerance was assessed after acute or sustained metformin treatment in knockin and wild-type control mice to examine the impact of the variant on metformin's glycaemic control. The minor allele frequency of this variant in the Māori and Pacific participants was 15.4%. There was no association of the variant with common metabolic parameters including diabetes status, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, or blood glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>. However, in the orthologous knockin mouse model, the rate of metformin uptake into the blood and tissues was increased. Acute metformin dosing increased insulin sensitivity in variant knockin mice but this effect was lost after longer-term metformin treatment. Metformin's effects on GDF-15 levels were also lost in variant knockin mice with longer-term metformin treatment. These data provide evidence that the SLC22A3 rs8187715 variant accelerates metformin uptake rate in vivo. While this acutely improves insulin sensitivity, there was no increased effect of metformin with longer-term dosing. Thus, our finding of a high prevalence of this variant specifically in Māori and Pacific peoples identifies it as a potential population-specific pharmacogenetic marker with potential to guide metformin therapy in these peoples.",

Myo-inositol, a promising therapeutic alternative, may improve glucose and lipid metabolism through the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) pathway. This study aimed to investigate the molecular and metabolic effects of Myo-inositol in a letrozole-induced rat model of PCOS. We divided rats into six groups: controls, PCOS, and different doses of Myo-inositol- or metformin-treated groups. We examined the rat blood glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, and hormone levels alongside ovarian histology and AMPK/GLUT4 expression via polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays. Myo-inositol treatment demonstrated dose-dependent improvements in glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles, and GLUT4 expression, with high-dose treatment reducing glucose by 0.85-fold and improving lipid metabolism compared to metformin treatment. Ovarian histology revealed partial restoration of follicular development, and AMPK activation supported enhanced glucose uptake. Myo-inositol effectively alleviated insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, offering a promising alternative to conventional PCOS treatments.",

Herein, we construct a nanotherapeutic platform based on biocompatible constituents to sensitize tumor cells for metformin therapy via cooperative glucose starvation. The nanoplatform was synthesized through the spontaneous biomineralization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and metformin in amorphous calcium phosphate nanosubstrate, which was further modified with polyethylene glycol and cRGD ligands. This biomineralized nanosystem could efficiently deliver the therapeutic payloads to tumor cells in a targeted and bioresponsive manner. Here GOx could catalyze the oxidation of glucose into gluconic acid and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thus depleting the glucose in tumor intracellular compartment while accelerating the release of the entrapped therapeutic payloads. The selective glucose deprivation would not only disrupt tumor energy metabolism, but also upregulate the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ and sensitize tumor cells to the metformin-induced CIP2A inhibition, leading to efficient apoptosis induction via PP2A-GSK3β-MCL-1 axis with negligible side effects. This study may offer new avenues for targeted tumor therapy in the clinical context.",

      "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic properties of metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, remain elusive. Here we report that metformin induces genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation by modulating the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). Exposing cancer cells to metformin leads to hypermethylation of tumor-promoting pathway genes and concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation. Metformin acts by upregulating microRNA let-7 through AMPK activation, leading to degradation of H19 long noncoding RNA, which normally binds to and inactivates SAHH. H19 knockdown activates SAHH, enabling DNA methyltransferase 3B to methylate a subset of genes. This metformin-induced H19 repression and alteration of gene methylation are recapitulated in endometrial cancer tissue samples obtained from patients treated with antidiabetic doses of metformin. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism of action for the drug metformin with implications for the molecular basis of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer. This novel mechanism of action also may be occurring in normal cells.",

Although immunochemotherapy combining PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum-metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody-based PD-L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 axis on cell surface but also down-regulating the total PD-L1 levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt-metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal-dependent PD-L1 degradation via the AMPK-TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD-L1 expression (e.g. HIF-1α and NF-κB), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD-L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti-tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK-mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD-L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.",

This study aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the efficacy of metformin in improving insulin sensitivity among women with PCOS and IR. This is a retrospective analysis of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 114 women diagnosed with PCOS and IR. All women received metformin treatment for 4 months. We incorporated 27 baseline clinical variables of the women into the construction of our machine learning model. We firstly compared 4 commonly used feature selection methods to screen valuable clinical variables. Then we used the valuable variables as inputs to evaluate the performance of 5 machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, in predicting the efficacy of metformin. Among the 5 machine learning models, Support Vector Machine performed the best with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.781 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.772-0.791). The key predictive variables identified were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The developed machine learning model could be applied to predict the efficacy of metformin in improving insulin sensitivity among women with PCOS and IR. The result could help doctors evaluate the efficacy of metformin in advance, optimize treatment plans, and thereby enhance overall clinical outcomes.",

In this research, cell proliferation was measured by methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was determined with Hoechst 33342 staining. Western blotting and cell cycle analyses were used to elucidate potential mechanisms of interaction between the drugs. It is shown that in cultured DU145 cells, vitamin D₃ combined with metformin exhibits synergistic effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. The underlying antitumor mechanisms may involve altered cycle distribution with a G1/S cell cycle arrest, activation of phospho-AMPK with subsequent inhibition of downstream mTOR signalling pathway, down-regulate c-Myc expression, and reducing the level of anti-apoptotic protein p-Bcl-2. In conclusion, metformin and vitamin D₃ synergistically inhibit DU145 cell growth, indicating a promising clinical therapeutic strategy for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiration is critical for cell proliferation. In addition to producing ATP, respiration generates biosynthetic precursors, such as aspartate, an essential substrate for nucleotide synthesis. Here, we show that in addition to depleting intracellular aspartate, electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition depletes aspartate-derived asparagine, increases ATF4 levels, and impairs mTOR complex I (mTORC1) activity. Exogenous asparagine restores proliferation, ATF4 and mTORC1 activities, and mTORC1-dependent nucleotide synthesis in the context of ETC inhibition, suggesting that asparagine communicates active respiration to ATF4 and mTORC1. Finally, we show that combination of the ETC inhibitor metformin, which limits tumor asparagine synthesis, and either asparaginase or dietary asparagine restriction, which limit tumor asparagine consumption, effectively impairs tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer. Because environmental asparagine is sufficient to restore tumor growth in the context of respiration impairment, our findings suggest that asparagine synthesis is a fundamental purpose of tumor mitochondrial respiration, which can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit to cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "To determine the longer-term effects of metformin treatment and behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We conducted a 3-parallel-arm, randomized trial. We enrolled overweight/obese adults who had been treated for solid tumors but had no ongoing cancer treatment and randomized them (<i>n</i> = 121) to either <i>1</i>) metformin (up to 2,000 mg), <i>2</i>) coach-directed behavioral weight loss, or <i>3</i>) self-directed care (control) for 12 months. We collected stool and serum at baseline (<i>n</i> = 114), 6 months (<i>n</i> = 109), and 12 months (<i>n</i> = 105). From stool, we extracted microbial DNA and conducted amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We measured SCFAs and other biochemical parameters from fasting serum. Of the 121 participants, 79% were female and 46% were Black, and the mean age was 60 years. Only metformin treatment significantly altered microbiota composition. Compared with control, metformin treatment increased amplicon sequence variants for <i>Escherichia</i> (confirmed as <i>Escherichia coli</i> by metagenomic sequencing) and <i>Ruminococcus torques</i> and decreased <i>Intestinibacter bartlettii</i> at both 6 and 12 months and decreased the genus <i>Roseburia</i>, including <i>R. faecis</i> and <i>R. intestinalis,</i> at 12 months. Effects were similar in comparison of the metformin group with the behavioral weight loss group. Metformin versus control also increased butyrate, acetate, and valerate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Behavioral weight loss versus control did not significantly alter microbiota composition but did increase acetate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Increases in acetate were associated with decreases in fasting insulin. Additional whole-genome metagenomic sequencing of a subset of the metformin group showed that metformin altered 62 metagenomic functional pathways, including an acetate-producing pathway and three pathways in glucose metabolism. Metformin, but not behavioral weight loss, impacted gut microbiota composition at 6 months and 12 months. Both metformin and behavioral weight loss altered circulating SCFAs at 6 months, including increasing acetate, which correlated with lower fasting insulin. Future research is needed to elucidate whether the gut microboime mediates or modifies metformin's health effects.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies on the impact of metformin and colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes have been limited by small size and confounding by indication, yielding inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to assess whether diabetes and pre-diagnostic metformin use influence CRC prognosis. The study was performed using the Colorectal Cancer Data Base Sweden, a register-linkage originating from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register with linkage to national health care registers and demographic registers. All adult patients diagnosed with primary non-metastatic CRC between 2007 and 2016, treated with curative surgery, were identified and followed up from 90 days post-surgery until December 31, 2022. Antidiabetic medication use was defined as dispensed prescription ≥6 months of use within 1 year of surgery. Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were divided into three treatment groups (i) diet only, (ii) metformin user, and (iii) non-metformin user. Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to recurrence, CRC-specific, and all-cause mortality, adjusted for relevant covariates. Of 33,028 non-metastatic CRC patients, 4539 (13.7%) had T2DM, with 1745 using metformin. A T2DM diagnosis was not associated with increased recurrence rate or CRC-specific mortality; HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.97 (95% CI 0.89-1.06) and HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.95 (95% CI 0.87-1.05), respectively, compared with non-diabetic patients.

T2DM is not associated with an elevated recurrence or CRC-specific mortality. Additionally, metformin use does not impact CRC prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Metformin, a biguanide commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been associated with potential beneficial effects across breast cancer subtypes in observational and preclinical studies. To determine whether the administration of adjuvant metformin (vs placebo) to patients with breast cancer without diabetes improves outcomes. MA.32, a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted in Canada, Switzerland, US, and UK, enrolled 3649 patients with high-risk nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving standard therapy between August 2010 and March 2013, with follow-up to October 2020. Patients were randomized (stratified for hormone receptor [estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor {ER/PgR}] status, positive vs negative; body mass index, ≤30 vs >30; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu], positive vs negative; and any vs no chemotherapy) to 850 mg of oral metformin twice a day (n = 1824) or oral placebo twice a day (n = 1825) for 5 years. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Of the 8 secondary outcomes, overall survival, distant relapse-free survival, and breast cancer-free interval were analyzed. Of the 3649 randomized patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 3643 women [99.8%]), all (100%) were included in analyses. After a second interim analysis, futility was declared for patients who were ER/PgR-, so the primary analysis was conducted for 2533 patients who were ER/PgR+. The median duration of follow-up in the ER/PgR+ group was 96.2 months (range, 0.2-121 months). Invasive disease-free survival events occurred in 465 patients who were ER/PgR+. The incidence rates for invasive disease-free survival events were 2.78 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 2.74 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21; P = .93), and the incidence rates for death were 1.46 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 1.32 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41; P = .47). Among patients who were ER/PgR-, followed up for a median of 94.1 months, incidence of invasive disease-free survival events was 3.58 vs 3.60 per 100 patient-years, respectively (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.30; P = .92). None of the 3 secondary outcomes analyzed in the ER/PgR+ group had statistically significant differences. Grade 3 nonhematological toxic events occurred more frequently in patients taking metformin than in patients taking placebo (21.5% vs 17.5%, respectively, P = .003). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the metformin vs placebo groups were hypertension (2.4% vs 1.9%), irregular menses (1.5% vs 1.4%), and diarrhea (1.9% vs 7.0%). Among patients with high-risk operable breast cancer without diabetes, the addition of metformin vs placebo to standard breast cancer treatment did not significantly improve invasive disease-free survival.

This is exploited to selectively target HCC. Hepatic HK2 deletion inhibits tumor incidence in a mouse model of hepatocarcinogenesis. Silencing HK2 in human HCC cells inhibits tumorigenesis and increases cell death, which cannot be restored by GCK or mitochondrial binding deficient HK2. Upon HK2 silencing, glucose flux to pyruvate and lactate is inhibited, but TCA fluxes are maintained. Serine uptake and glycine secretion are elevated suggesting increased requirement for one-carbon contribution. Consistently, vulnerability to serine depletion increases. The decrease in glycolysis is coupled to elevated oxidative phosphorylation, which is diminished by metformin, further increasing cell death and inhibiting tumor growth. Neither HK2 silencing nor metformin alone inhibits mTORC1, but their combination inhibits mTORC1 in an AMPK-independent and REDD1-dependent mechanism. Finally, HK2 silencing synergizes with sorafenib to inhibit tumor growth.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal adenoma (CA), especially high-risk CA (HRCA), is a precancerous lesion with high prevalence and recurrence rate and accounts for about 90% incidence of sporadic colorectal cancer cases worldwide. Currently, recurrent CA can only be treated with repeated invasive polypectomies, while safe and promising pharmaceutical invention strategies are still missing due to the lack of reliable in vitro model for CA-related drug screening. We have established a large-scale patient-derived high-risk colorectal adenoma organoid (HRCA-PDO) biobank containing 37 PDO lines derived from 33 patients and then conducted a series of high-throughput and high-content HRCA drug screening. We established the primary culture system with the non-WNT3a medium which highly improved the purity while maintained the viability of HRCA-PDOs. We also proved that the HRCA-PDOs replicated the histological features, cellular diversity, genetic mutations, and molecular characteristics of the primary adenomas. Especially, we identified the dysregulated stem genes including LGR5, c-Myc, and OLFM4 as the markers of adenoma, which are well preserved in HRCA-PDOs. Based on the HRCA-PDO biobank, a customized 139 compound library was applied for drug screening. Four drugs including metformin, BMS754807, panobinostat and AT9283 were screened out as potential hits with generally consistent inhibitory efficacy on HRCA-PDOs. As a representative, metformin was discovered to hinder HRCA-PDO growth in vitro and in vivo by restricting the stemness maintenance. This study established a promising HRCA-PDO biobank and conducted the first high-throughput and high-content HRCA drug screening in order to shed light on the prevention of colorectal cancer.",

SPARTAN was a phase III randomized controlled trial in which nmCRPC patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive androgen deprivation therapy with or without apalutamide. We focused on 5 commonly prescribed classes of medications: metformin, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) based on a plausible biological and clinical rationale. To determine the potential effect modification, we applied multivariable Cox regression models for OS and MFS separately with additional interaction terms. To determine the independent association of concomitant medications with OS and MFS, we used IPTW-based log-rank test. A 2-sided p < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. We did not find statistically significant differences in effect from apalutamide on OS across subgroups stratified by concomitant exposure to any of the medication classes. While there was some difference in the treatment effect from apalutamide on MFS between patients with concomitant statins (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.20; 95 % CI: 0.15-0.28) versus without concomitant statins (aHR: 0.31 [0.24-0.39]), this did not reach the pre-specified threshold of statistical significance (p = 0.011). On IPTW-based analysis, patients treated concomitantly with metformin (median: not reached versus 31 months; p = 0.002), or ACEI (median: 37 versus 29 months, p = 0.006) had significantly improved MFS. In this post-hoc exploratory analysis of SPARTAN, effects of apalutamide on MFS and OS were consistent across subgroups stratified by exposure to concomitant medications. Exposure to concomitant metformin and ACEI was independently associated with a significant improvement in MFS.",

Immortal time bias may be one importance source of heterogeneity, as it is widely present in previous cohort studies and may severely impair the validity. Our study aimed to examine whether metformin therapy improves pancreatic cancer survival, and to assess the impact of immortal time bias on the effect estimation of metformin in cohort studies. PubMed, EMbase and SciVerse Scopus were searched. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were derived using a random-effects model. Pooled RR from the six studies without immortal time bias showed no association between metformin and mortality in pancreatic cancer patients (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05; p = 0.22 and I<sup>2</sup> = 75%). In contrast, pooled RR from the nine studies with immortal time bias showed a reduction of 24% in mortality associated with metformin (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69, 0.84; p < 0.001 and I<sup>2</sup> = 1%). From a meta-regression model, existence of immortal time bias was associated with a reduction of 18% in the effect estimate of metformin on pancreatic cancer survival (ratio of RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70, 0.96; p = 0.02). In conclusions, cumulative evidence from cohort studies does not support a beneficial effect of metformin on pancreatic cancer survival. The association between metformin and pancreatic cancer survival has been greatly exaggerated in previous cohort studies due to the wide existence of immortal time bias. More rigorous designs and statistical methods are needed to account for immortal time bias.",

The study linked 22,324 LC patients from the Cancer Registry of Norway diagnosed 2005-2014 with the Norwegian Prescription Database. We estimated associations of pre- and post-diagnostic metformin use with overall survival (OS) and LC-specific survival (LCSS) using multivariable time-fixed and time-dependent Cox regression. Pre-diagnostic metformin use was not associated with improved survival in all patients. Nevertheless, pre-diagnostic metformin use was associated with better LCSS in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.99) and in patients with regional stage SCC (HR = 0.67; 95%CI 0.47-0.95). Post-diagnostic metformin use was associated with improved LCSS in all patients (HR = 0.83; 95%CI 0.73-0.95), in patients with SCC (HR = 0.75; 95%CI 0.57-0.98), regional stage LC (HR = 0.74; 95%CI 0.59-0.94), and regional stage SCC (HR = 0.57; 95%CI 0.38-0.86). OS showed similar results. Analyses of cumulative use showed a dose-response relationship in all patients, patients with adenocarcinoma and SCC, and with regional and metastatic LC. Metformin use was associated with improved survival, especially LCSS in patients with regional stage SCC. Further prospective studies are required to clarify the role of metformin in LC treatment.",

This study assessed the potential role of metformin and statins, medications for diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemia (HLP), in reducing HCC risk among these patients. We included CHC patients from the T-COACH study who failed antiviral therapy. We tracked the onset of HCC 1.5 years post-therapy by linking to Taiwan's cancer registry data from 2003 to 2019. We accounted for death and liver transplantation as competing risks and employed Gray's cumulative incidence and Cox subdistribution hazards models to analyze HCC development. Out of 2,779 patients, 480 (17.3%) developed HCC post-therapy. DM patients not using metformin had a 51% increased risk of HCC compared to non-DM patients, while HLP patients on statins had a 50% reduced risk compared to those without HLP. The 5-year HCC incidence was significantly higher for metformin non-users (16.5%) versus non-DM patients (11.3%; adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]=1.51; P=0.007) and metformin users (3.1%; aSHR=1.59; P=0.022). Statin use in HLP patients correlated with a lower HCC risk (3.8%) compared to non-HLP patients (12.5%; aSHR=0.50; P<0.001). Notably, the increased HCC risk associated with non-use of metformin was primarily seen in non-cirrhotic patients, whereas statins decreased HCC risk in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Metformin and statins may have a chemopreventive effect against HCC in CHC patients who failed antiviral therapy. These results support the need for personalized preventive strategies in managing HCC risk.",

      "abstract": "Metformin use has been associated with a decreased risk of some cancers, although data on head and neck cancer (HNC) are scarce. We explored the relation between the use of antidiabetic drugs and the risk of HNC. We conducted a case-control analysis in the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of people with incident HNC between 1995 and 2013 below the age of 90 years. Six controls per case were matched on age, sex, calendar time, general practice and number of years of active history in the CPRD prior to the index date. Other potential confounders including body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption and comorbidities were also evaluated. The final analyses were adjusted for BMI, smoking and diabetes mellitus (or diabetes duration in a sensitivity analysis). Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Use of metformin was neither associated with a statistically significant altered risk of HNC overall (1-29 prescriptions: adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61-1.24 and ≥ 30 prescriptions adjusted OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53-1.22), nor was long-term use of sulphonylureas (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59-1.30), or any insulin use (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.35). However, we found a (statistically non-significant) decreased risk of laryngeal cancer associated with long-term metformin use (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-1.03). In this population-based study, the use of antidiabetic drugs was not associated with a materially altered risk of HNC. Our data suggest a protective effect of long-term metformin use for laryngeal cancer.",

This cohort study utilized data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, following T2D patients from 2008 to 202 database's baseline. Metformin use was defined as achieving ≥80% of the medication possession ratio (MPR) and ≥28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD) within three months. The control group included patients with ≥80% MPR from other antidiabetic agents, ensuring active treatment comparability. Propensity score matching was applied to balance covariates, while competing risk models accounted for mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), incidence rates (IRs), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Metformin users demonstrated a lower SSNHL incidence (IR: 11.48 per 10,000 person-years) compared to non-users (IR: 15.66 per 10,000 person-years), with an IRR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82; p < 0.0001). Adjusted HRs indicated a 27% reduction in SSNHL risk (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.66-0.82). Higher cumulative doses (Q4: HR 0.36; 95% CI: 0.29-0.46) and daily doses ≥1 DDD (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87) were linked to further risk reductions. Metformin use was also associated with lower overall mortality. Metformin use is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in SSNHL risk and lower mortality in T2D patients. The rigorous definitions of metformin exposure and an actively treated comparator group emphasize these findings, suggesting metformin's potential role in SSNHL prevention and improved survival.",

T2DM patients aged ≥ 40 years and newly treated with either metformin (n=171,753, \"ever users of metformin\") or other antidiabetic drugs (n=75,499, \"never users of metformin\") within 1998-2002 were followed for at least 6 months for kidney cancer until 31 December 2009.

We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study to evaluate if post-diagnostic use of low-dose aspirin, statins, and metformin was associated with BC-specific survival. Women aged ≥ 50 years and diagnosed with BC in 2004-2017, who survived ≥ 12 months after diagnosis (follow-up started 12 months after diagnosis), were identified in the Cancer Registry of Norway. The Norwegian Prescription Database provided information on prescriptions. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between post-diagnostic use and BC-specific survival, overall and by oestrogen receptor (ER) status. A total of 26,190 patients were included. Of these, 5324 (20%), 7591 (29%), and 1495 (6%) were post-diagnostic users of low-dose aspirin, statins, and metformin, respectively. The median follow-up was 6.1 years, and 2169 (8%) patients died from BC. HRs for use, compared to no use, were estimated at 0.96 (95% CI 0.85-1.08) for low-dose aspirin (ER+: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.83-1.13; ER-: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.29, p value for interaction = 0.562), 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.94) for statins (ER+: HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.09; ER-: HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-1.00, p value for interaction = 0.259), and 0.70 (95% CI 0.51-0.96) for metformin (compared to use of non-metformin antidiabetics) (ER+: HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-1.01; ER-: HR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.72-3.62, p value for interaction = 0.077). We found evidence supporting an association between post-diagnostic use of statins and metformin and survival, in patients with BC.

They were followed until December 31, 2011. Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score was used to estimate hazard ratios. Results showed that the respective incidence of lung cancer in ever and never users was 173.36 and 292.65 per 100000 person-years in the original sample; and was 211.71 and 292.65, respectively, in the matched sample.

      "abstract": "This study evaluated whether metformin might reduce esophageal cancer risk. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed during 1999-2005 were recruited from the reimbursement database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance. Those newly treated with metformin (n = 288013, \"ever users of metformin\") or other antidiabetic drugs (n = 16216, \"never users of metformin\") were followed until December 31, 2011. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in a matched-pair sample of 16216 never users and 16216 ever users. Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score. The risk associated with infection of Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus was also evaluated. Results showed that the incidence of esophageal cancer in ever and never users was 25.03 and 50.87 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 0.487 (0.347-0.684) suggested a significantly lower risk among metformin users. Hazard ratios comparing the first (< 21.47 months), second (21.47-46.00 months) and third (> 46.00 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin use to never users was 1.184 (0.834-1.680), 0.403 (0.276-0.588) and 0.113 (0.071-0.179), respectively. Infection of Helicobacter pylori (but not the other viral infections) significantly increased the risk, which could be ameliorated by metformin. Analyses in the matched sample consistently supported a protective role of metformin. In conclusion, metformin reduces esophageal cancer risk when the cumulative duration is more than approximately 2 years.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence for the association between postdiagnostic metformin use and survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited. Using the Taiwan Cancer Registry database, a cohort of 16,676 diabetic patients newly diagnosed with CRC from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2014, followed until December 31, 2016, was identified. Postdiagnostic use of metformin (two or more prescriptions after CRC diagnosis) was defined as a time-dependent covariate with 6-month lag. Multivariate Cox regression model and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate adjusted effects of metformin on all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality during follow-up. A number of 11,438 (69%) received metformin after CRC diagnosis. Overall, 7,393 deaths, including 4,845 CRC-specific deaths, were observed during 64,322 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, metformin users had lower all-cause mortality than did nonusers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.44) and lower CRC-specific mortality (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.39-0.44). Similar but somewhat attenuated effects were observed after stabilized IPTW (HR for all-cause mortality, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.53-0.59; HR for CRC-specific mortality, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.55-0.61). Similar results were observed in stratified analyses of 2,112 patients with no prediagnostic metformin use and 14,564 patients with prediagnostic metformin use. Findings for both outcomes were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. Use of postdiagnostic metformin was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality, regardless of prior metformin use. These findings support the use of metformin as an adjunct to standard care of diabetic patients with CRC.",

In vivo studies in immunocompetent mice confirmed the potential of this combination in reducing tumor growth (P < 0.001) and preventing metastasis (P < 0.05).Taken together our results suggest that metformin plus propranolol combined treatment might be beneficial for triple negative breast cancer control, with no symptoms of toxicity.",

From this, there is growing interest in the use of metformin to treat and prevent cancer. Studies have investigated chemopreventive mechanisms including alterations in calorie intake, cancer metabolism, and cell signaling. Repurposing the drug is challenging due to its metabolic effects and non-uniform effects on different types of cancer. In our previously published studies, we observed that benzo[a]pyrene treated mice receiving metformin significantly reduced lung adenomas; however, mice had reduced weight gain. In this study, we compared chemoprevention diets with and without metformin to evaluate the effects of diet vs. effects of metformin. We also performed tandem mass spectrometry on mouse serum to assess metabolomic alterations associated with metformin treatment. In metformin cohorts, the rate of weight gain was reduced, but weights did not vary between diets. There was no weight difference between diets without metformin. Interestingly, caloric intake was increased in metformin treated mice. Metabolomic analysis revealed metabolite alterations consistent with metformin treatment. Based on these results, we conclude that previous reductions in lung adenomas may have been occurred from anticancer effects of metformin rather than a potentially toxic effect such as calorie restriction.",

BaP (50 mg/kg) was used for induction of lung cancer and mice were treated with metformin, atorvastatin or their combination. Metformin + atorvastatin combination significantly (p< 0.001) improved the body weight, liver weight, suppressed the lung weight and tumor incidence and altered the levels of immunocompetent cells, polyamines, lung tumor markers, lung parameters and antioxidant parameters, respectively. Metformin + atorvastatin combination also suppressed cytokines levels, inflammatory parameters and caspase parameters. On the basis of the results, we can conclude that metformin + atorvastatin combination remarkably suppressed lung cancer via the inflammatory pathway.",

      "abstract": "Well-tolerated and commonly used medications are increasingly assessed for reducing breast cancer risk. These include metformin and statins, both linked to reduced hormone availability and cell proliferation or growth and sometimes prescribed concurrently. We investigated independent and joint associations of these medications with mammographic breast density (MBD), a useful biomarker for the effect of chemopreventive agents on breast cancer risk. Using data from a cross-sectional study of 770 women (78% Hispanic, aged 40-61 years, in a mammography cohort with high cardiometabolic burden), we examined the association of self-reported \"ever\" use of statins and metformin with MBD measured via clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classifications (relative risk regression) and continuous semi-automated percent and size of dense area (Cumulus) (linear regression), adjusted for age, body mass index, education, race, menopausal status, age at first birth, and insulin use. We observed high statin (27%), metformin (13%), and combination (9%) use, and most participants were overweight/obese (83%) and parous (87%). Statin use was associated with a lower likelihood of high density BI-RADS (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.80), percent dense area (PD) (β = - 6.56, 95% CI = - 9.05 to - 4.06), and dense area (DA) (β = - 9.05, 95% CI = - 14.89 to - 3.22). Metformin use was associated with lower PD and higher non-dense area (NDA), but associations were attenuated by co-medication with statins. Compared to non-use of either medication, statin use alone or with metformin were associated with lower PD and DA (e.g., β = - 6.86, 95% CI: - 9.67, - 4.05 and β = - 7.07, 95% CI: - 10.97, - 3.17, respectively, for PD) and higher NDA (β = 25.05, 95% CI: 14.06, 36.03; β = 29.76, 95% CI: 14.55, 44.96, respectively). Statin use was consistently associated with lower MBD, measured both through clinical radiologist assessment and continuous relative and absolute measures, including dense area. Metformin use was associated with lower PD and higher NDA, but this may be driven by co-medication with statins. These results support that statins may lower MBD but need confirmation with prospective and clinical data to distinguish the results of medication use from that of disease.",

We assessed the association between metformin use and survival in a pooled analysis of patient data from 1,731 individuals from the randomized AVAglio, CENTRIC and CORE trials. We performed multivariate Cox analyses for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) comparing patients' use of metformin at baseline and/or during concomitant radiochemotherapy (TMZ/RT). Further exploratory analyses investigated the effect of metformin with a history of diabetes and nonfasting glucose levels in relation to OS or PFS of glioblastoma patients. Metformin alone or in any combination was not significantly associated with OS or PFS (at baseline, hazard ratio [HR] for OS = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65-1.16; HR for PFS = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.64-1.10; during TMZ/RT HR for OS = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.68-1.38; HR for PFS = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.74-1.41). We found a statistically nonsignificant association of metformin monotherapy with glioblastoma survival at baseline (HR for OS = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.42-1.10; HR for PFS = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.91), but not during the TMZ/RT period (HR for OS = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.51-1.56; HR for PFS = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.64-1.73). Diabetes mellitus or increased nonfasting glucose levels were not associated with a difference in OS or PFS in our selected study population. Metformin did not prolong survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in our analysis. Additional studies may identify patients with specific tumor characteristics that are associated with potential benefit from treatment with metformin, possibly due to metabolic vulnerabilities.",

At baseline, the average body mass index was 35 kg/m2; mean IGF-1 was 72.9 (SD, 21.7) ng/mL; and mean IGF1:IGFBP3 molar ratio was 0.17 (SD, 0.05). At 6 months, weight changes were -1.0% (P = 0.07), -4.2% (P < 0.0001), and -2.8% (P < 0.0001) in self-directed, coach-directed, and metformin groups, respectively. Compared with the self-directed group, participants in metformin had significant decreases on IGF-1 (mean difference in change: -5.50 ng/mL, P = 0.02) and IGF1:IGFBP3 molar ratio (mean difference in change: -0.0119, P = 0.011) at 3 months. The significant decrease of IGF-1 remained in participants with obesity at 6 months (mean difference in change: -7.2 ng/mL; 95% CI: -13.3 to -1.1), but not in participants with overweight (P for interaction = 0.045). There were no significant differences in changes between the coach-directed and self-directed groups. There were no differences in outcomes at 12 months. In cancer survivors with obesity, metformin may have a short-term effect on IGF-1 reduction that wanes over time.",

      "abstract": "Docetaxel chemotherapy remains a standard of care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Docetaxel modestly increases survival, yet results in frequent occurrence of side effects and resistant disease. An alternate chemotherapy with greater efficacy and minimal side effects is needed. Acquisition of metabolic aberrations promoting increased survival and metastasis in CRPC cells includes constitutive activation of Akt, loss of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity due to Ser-485/491 phosphorylation, and overexpression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR). We report that combination of simvastatin and metformin, within pharmacologic dose range (500 nmol/L to 4 μmol/L simvastatin and 250 μmol/L to 2 mmol/L metformin), significantly and synergistically reduces C4-2B3/B4 CRPC cell viability and metastatic properties, with minimal adverse effects on normal prostate epithelial cells. Combination of simvastatin and metformin decreased Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation and AMPKα Ser-485/491 phosphorylation; increased Thr-172 phosphorylation and AMPKα activity, as assessed by increased Ser-79 and Ser-872 phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and HMG-CoAR, respectively; decreased HMG-CoAR activity; and reduced total cellular cholesterol and its synthesis in both cell lines. Studies of C4-2B4 orthotopic NCr-nu/nu mice further demonstrated that combination of simvastatin and metformin (3.5-7.0 μg/g body weight simvastatin and 175-350 μg/g body weight metformin) daily by oral gavage over a 9-week period significantly inhibited primary ventral prostate tumor formation, cachexia, bone metastasis, and biochemical failure more effectively than 24 μg/g body weight docetaxel intraperitoneally injected every 3 weeks, 7.0 μg/g/day simvastatin, or 350 μg/g/day metformin treatment alone, with significantly less toxicity and mortality than docetaxel, establishing combination of simvastatin and metformin as a promising chemotherapeutic alternative for metastatic CRPC.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of metformin and weight loss on biomarkers associated with breast cancer prognosis. Overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 333) were randomly assigned to metformin vs placebo and to a weight loss intervention vs control (ie, usual care). The 2 × 2 factorial design allows a single randomized trial to investigate the effect of two factors and interactions between them. Outcomes were changes in fasting insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), estradiol, testosterone, and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The trial was powered for a main effects analysis of metformin vs placebo and weight loss vs control. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. A total of 313 women (94.0%) completed the six-month trial. High prescription adherence (ie, ≥80% of pills taken) ranged from 65.9% of participants in the metformin group to 81.3% of those in the placebo group (P < .002). Mean percent weight loss was statistically significantly higher in the weight loss group (-5.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -6.3% to -4.8%) compared with the control group (-2.7%, 95% CI = -3.5% to -1.9%). Statistically significant group differences (ie, percent change in metformin group minus placebo group) were -7.9% (95% CI = -15.0% to -0.8%) for insulin, -10.0% (95% CI = -18.5% to -1.5%) for estradiol, -9.5% (95% CI = -15.2% to -3.8%) for testosterone, and 7.5% (95% CI = 2.4% to 12.6%) for SHBG. Statistically significant group differences (ie, percent change in weight loss group minus placebo group) were -12.5% (95% CI = -19.6% to -5.3%) for insulin and 5.3% (95% CI = 0.2% to 10.4%) for SHBG. As adjuvant therapy, weight loss and metformin were found to be a safe combination strategy that modestly lowered estrogen levels and advantageously affected other biomarkers thought to be on the pathway for reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Metformin treatment is associated with a decreased risk and better prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism of metformin's PC growth inhibition in the context of a prediabetic state is unknown. We used a Panc02 pancreatic tumor cell transplant model in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to compare the effects of metformin and the direct mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin on PC growth, glucose regulation, mTOR pathway signaling, and candidate microRNA (miR) expression. In DIO/prediabetic mice, metformin and rapamycin significantly reduced pancreatic tumor growth and mTOR-related signaling. The rapamycin effects centered on decreased mTOR-regulated growth and survival signaling, including increased expression of let-7b and cell cycle-regulating miRs. Metformin (but not rapamycin) reduced glucose and insulin levels and expression of miR-34a and its direct targets Notch, Slug, and Snail. Metformin also reduced the number and size of Panc02 tumor spheres in vitro and inhibited the expression of Notch in spheroids. Our results suggest that metformin and rapamycin can both inhibit pancreatic tumor growth in obese, prediabetic mice through shared and distinct mechanisms. Metformin and direct mTOR inhibitors, alone or possibly in combination, represent promising intervention strategies for breaking the diabetes-PC link.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with increased breast cancer risk, but commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications such as metformin may reduce risk. Few studies have investigated T2D and medications together in relation to breast cancer. Data came from 44 541 Sister Study participants aged 35 to 74 years at enrollment (2003-2009) who satisfied eligibility criteria, followed through 15 September 2017. Information on time-varying, self-reported, physician-diagnosed, prevalent and incident T2D, use of antidiabetic medications, and covariates was obtained from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Incident breast cancers were confirmed with medical records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. During follow-up (median, 8.6 years), 2678 breast cancers were diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment. There were 3227 women (7.2%) with prevalent and 2389 (5.3%) with incident T2D, among whom 61% (n = 3386) were ever treated with metformin. There was no overall association between T2D and breast cancer risk (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.13). However, T2D was associated with increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90-2.16). Compared with not having T2D, T2D with metformin use was not associated with overall breast cancer risk (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15), but it was associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.05) and increased risk of ER-negative (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.88) and triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.06-2.83). The inverse association with ER-positive cancer was stronger for longer duration (≥10 year) metformin use (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.01; P for trend = 0.09). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggest that associations between T2D and breast cancer may differ by hormone receptor status and that associations between T2D and ER-positive breast cancer may be reduced by long-term metformin use.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and increased risk of pregnancy complications. Metformin treatment reduces the risk of late miscarriage and preterm birth in pregnant women with PCOS. Whether the protective effect of metformin involves immunological changes has not been determined. To investigate the effect of metformin on the maternal immunological status in women with PCOS. A post-hoc analysis was performed of two randomized controlled trials, PregMet and PregMet2, including longitudinal maternal serum samples from 615 women with PCOS. Women were randomized to metformin or placebo from first trimester to delivery. Twenty-two cytokines and C-reactive protein were measured in serum sampled at gestational weeks 5 to 12, 19, 32, and 36. Metformin treatment was associated with higher serum levels of several multifunctional cytokines throughout pregnancy, with the strongest effect on eotaxin (P < .001), interleukin-17 (P = .03), and basic fibroblast growth factor (P = .04). Assessment of the combined cytokine development confirmed the impact of metformin on half of the 22 cytokines. The immunomodulating effect of metformin was more potent in normal weight and overweight women than in obese women. Moreover, normoandrogenic women had the strongest effect of metformin in early pregnancy, whereas hyperandrogenic women presented increasing effect throughout pregnancy. It appears that metformin has immunomodulating rather than anti-inflammatory properties in pregnancy. Its effect on the serum levels of many multifunctional cytokines demonstrates robust, persisting, and body mass-dependent immune mobilization in pregnant women with PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Pre-clinical studies suggest that metformin and statins may delay prostate cancer (PCa) metastases; however, data in humans are limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first human study aimed to quantify the individual and joint effects of statin and metformin use among patients with high-risk PCa. This population-based retrospective cohort study identified patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare Prescription Drug Event files. The association with all-cause and PCa mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model with competing causes of death, where propensity scores were used to adjusted imbalances in covariates across groups. Based on 12 700 patients with high-risk PCa, statin alone or in combination with metformin was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.96; and HR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83, respectively) and PCa mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.92) and 0.64; 95% CI, d 0.51-0.81, respectively. The effects were more pronounced in post-diagnostic users: combination use of metformin/statins was associated with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.57-0.80), and 54% reduction in PCa mortality (95% CI, 0.30-0.69). No significant association of metformin alone was observed with either all-cause mortality or PCa mortality. Statin use alone or in combination with metformin was associated with lower all-cause and PCa mortality among high-risk patients, particularly in post-diagnostic settings; further studies are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: To compare survival outcomes between endometrial cancer (EC) patients with diabetes who used metformin to those who did not use metformin. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of EC patients who were diabetes at the time of their cancer diagnosis and had been scheduled for elective surgery at Rajavithi Hospital between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2013. The patients were excluded if they had type I diabetes mellitus and a history of other cancers. Results: Of 1,262 EC patients in the study period, there was 212 (16.8%) patients who met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 90 (42.5%) were non-metformin users and 122 (57.5%) were metformin users. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the 5-year overall survivals (76.4% vs 77.9%, p=0.959) and the 5-year progression-free survivals (92.6% vs 84.7%, p=0.091) did not significantly differ between the both groups. On Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were FIGO stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and cervical involvement. Patients with non-endometrioid histology and advanced stage were found to have a significant effect on progression-free survival (PFS). However, metformin used did not predict either OS (HR, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.56-1.73; p=0.959) or PFS (HR, 2.19; 95%CI, 0.86-5.55; p=0.099). Conclusion: Overall, a significant effect of metformin on survival outcomes in EC patients with diabetes was not found in the current study. Larger studies with a prospective randomized control design are needed to clarify the benefit of metformin as a strategy for endometrial cancer prevention and treatment.",

In 143,035 men (≥ 65 yrs old) of SEER-Medicare 2007-2015, we identified White (N = 110,430), Black (N = 13,520) and Other Race (N = 19,085) men diagnosed with incident HRC.

We found independent and joint associations of metformin and TTh with incident prostate (odds ratio [OR]<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.54) and colorectal cancers (OR<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64), but not with male breast cancer. There were also inversed joint associations of metformin and TTh with HRCs (OR<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38-0.54). Similar reduced associations with HRCs were identified among White, Black, and Other Race men. Pre-diagnostic use of metformin and TTh were, independently and jointly, inversely associated with incident prostate and colorectal cancers. The risk of HRCs was also reduced among White, Black and Other Race men. Greatest reduced associations of prostate and colorectal cancers and HRCs were mainly observed in combination of metformin and TTh. Larger studies are needed to confirm the independent and joint association of metformin plus TTh with these cancers in understudied and underserved populations.",

Previous epidemiological studies however have been limited by small sample sizes and certain time-related biases. This study aimed to investigate whether colorectal cancer patients with type 2 diabetes who were exposed to metformin had reduced cancer-specific mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,197 colorectal cancer patients newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2009 (identified from English cancer registries) with type 2 diabetes (based upon Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD, prescription and diagnosis records). In this cohort 382 colorectal cancer-specific deaths occurred up to 2012 from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data. Metformin use was identified from CPRD prescription records. Using time-dependent Cox regression models, unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were calculated for the association between post-diagnostic exposure to metformin and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Overall, there was no evidence of an association between metformin use and cancer-specific death before or after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80, 1.40). In addition, after adjustment for confounders, there was also no evidence of associations between other diabetic medications and cancer-specific mortality including sulfonylureas (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86, 1.51), insulin use (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.95, 1.93) or other anti-diabetic medications including thiazolidinediones (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46, 1.14). Similar associations were observed by duration of use and for all-cause mortality. This population-based study, the largest to date, does not support a protective association between metformin and survival in colorectal cancer patients.",

Inflammation is one biological mechanism hypothesized to mediate these associations. In this phase II, multicenter, 2 × 2 factorial trial, 139 patients with breast and colorectal cancer who completed standard therapy were randomized to one of four treatment groups for 12 weeks: exercise alone, metformin alone, exercise and metformin, or control. Inflammation outcomes included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor two (sTNFαR2), and IL6. The primary modeling strategy evaluated the trial product estimand that was quantified using a generalized linear mixed model. Compared with control, exercise alone reduced hs-CRP [-30.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -50.3, -1.0] and IL6 (-30.9%; 95% CI, -47.3, -9.5) but did not change sTNFαR2 (1.0%; 95% CI, -10.4, 13.9). Compared with control, metformin alone did not change hs-CRP (-13.9%; 95% CI, -40.0, 23.4), sTNFαR2 (-10.4%; 95% CI, -21.3, 2.0), or IL6 (-22.9%; 95% CI, -42.3, 2.0). Compared with control, exercise and metformin reduced sTNFαR2 (-13.1%; 95% CI, -22.9, -1.0) and IL6 (-38.7%; 95% CI, -52.3, -18.9) but did not change hs-CRP (-20.5%; 95% CI, -44.0, 12.7). The combination of exercise and metformin was not synergistic for hs-CRP, sTNFαR2, or IL6. In survivors of breast and colorectal cancer with low baseline physical activity and without type 2 diabetes, exercise and metformin reduced measures of inflammation that are associated with cancer recurrence and mortality.",

Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to describe the association between use of metformin and all-cause mortality following diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma. There were 300 people with type 2 diabetes and pleural or unspecified mesothelioma of whom 148 had ever used metformin and 290 died during follow up.

To investigate risk and protective factors associated with the occurrence of ampullary tumors and whether these factors differ between ampullary tumors of the intestinal and pancreatobiliary subtypes or between adenomas and carcinomas. The association between a large set of exposome features and ampullary tumors occurrence was investigated in a bi-centric case-control study after ethic committee approval and power calculation. In 223 histologically confirmed patients and 446 controls, previous cholecystectomy (odd ratio [OR] = 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-3.20) and proton pump inhibitors use (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.16-2.37) were associated with increased risk of ampullary tumors, aspirin use (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.90) and light alcohol intake (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.38-0.76) with reduced risk. A previous cholecystectomy was also associated with tumors of intestinal subtype and with both adenomas and carcinomas, and proton pump inhibitors use with adenomas only. Smoking, body mass index, family history of cancers, previous ulcer, diabetes and use of statins, insulin and metformin were not significant factors. This is the first case-control study specifically highlighting factors associated with the occurrence of ampullary tumors. We report factors that are novel and plausible, in keeping with mechanisms described for other gastrointestinal tumors and with potential clinical relevance.",

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of diabetes and diabetes medications on risk of second breast cancer events (SBCE) and mortality. This population-based cohort study was conducted among women diagnosed with early-stage (I-II) BC and enrolled in an integrated health plan. Exposures of interest were diabetes and medication classes including insulin, metformin, and sulfonylureas. Outcomes of interest were SBCE defined as recurrence or second primary BC, BC-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for diabetes and medication use while accounting for potential confounders and competing risks. Among 4,216 women, 13 % developed SBCE during a median follow-up of 6.3 years. 610 women had diabetes of which 76 % used oral diabetes medication and/or insulin. Findings suggested that diabetes increased the risk of recurrence (HR = 1.57; 95 % CI 1.09-2.25) but not overall SBCE (HR = 1.29; 95 % CI 0.94-1.76) or second primary BC (HR = 0.74; 95 % CI 0.39-1.41). Among women with diabetes, insulin use was associated with increased risks of recurrence (HR = 1.94; 95 % CI 1.08-3.48) and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.33; 95 % CI 1.70-3.20). Metformin use was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.38-0.79). Our findings show an association between diabetes and increased recurrence risk, and risk may be greater among insulin users. Metformin may reduce all-cause mortality among BC survivors. Given the growing breast cancer survivor population, further research in larger, more diverse populations is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDEpidemiologic studies suggest that metformin has antitumor effects. Laboratory studies indicate metformin impacts cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). As part of a phase II trial, we evaluated the impact of metformin on CSC number and on carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs) and clinical outcomes in nondiabetic patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).METHODSThirty-eight patients with stage IIC (n = 1)/III (n = 25)/IV (n = 12) EOC were treated with either (a) neoadjuvant metformin, debulking surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy plus metformin or (b) neoadjuvant chemotherapy and metformin, interval debulking surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy plus metformin. Metformin-treated tumors, compared with historical controls, were evaluated for CSC number and chemotherapy response. Primary endpoints were (a) a 2-fold or greater reduction in aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) CD133+ CSCs and (b) a relapse-free survival at 18 months of more than 50%.RESULTSMetformin was well tolerated. Median progression-free survival was 18.0 months (95% CI 14.0-21.6) with relapse-free survival at 18 months of 59.3% (95% CI 38.6-70.5). Median overall survival was 57.9 months (95% CI 28.0-not estimable). Tumors treated with metformin had a 2.4-fold decrease in ALDH+CD133+ CSCs and increased sensitivity to cisplatin ex vivo. Furthermore, metformin altered the methylation signature in CA-MSCs, which prevented CA-MSC-driven chemoresistance in vitro.CONCLUSIONTranslational studies confirm an impact of metformin on EOC CSCs and suggest epigenetic change in the tumor stroma may drive the platinum sensitivity ex vivo. Consistent with this, metformin therapy was associated with better-than-expected overall survival, supporting the use of metformin in phase III studies.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT01579812.",

      "abstract": "The biguanide drug metformin is one of the most commonly used medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetics are at an increased risk for cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients taking metformin suffering from prostate, colon, lung, thyroid, and esophageal cancers. Metformin's main antineoplastic mechanism of action is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha, and activation of p53. We investigated the overall survival of type 2 diabetic patients on metformin with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma using the Computerized Patient Record System at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis TN. Lymphoma and pancreatic cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were sorted into an experimental (metformin) group and a control (nonmetformin) group. Patients were compared on baseline characteristics including race, body mass index, and age. Cancer outcomes including overall survival, metastasis, recurrences, and incidence of new malignancies were recorded. Hemoglobin A1C, creatinine and cancer treatment modalities were recorded and compared. Statistical analyses used included unpaired t tests and Chi-squared tests. There was significantly greater overall long-term survival in the metformin group compared to the nonmetformin group for lymphoma (5.89 vs 1.29 years, P < 0.001) and for pancreatic cancer (0.68 vs 0.22 years, P = 0.016). Cancer treatment modalities in both groups were comparable. Metformin is associated with a significant, positive effect of increased overall survival in type 2 diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma. These results are encouraging, and prospective studies should be done to further investigate metformin's effects in cancer.",

Despite the advances in basic science and clinical research, the overall survival rate of OSCC remains low. Thus finding novel effective therapeutic agents for OSCC is necessary. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of combined metformin and 4SC-202 in OSCC. Our results showed that metformin and 4SC-202 synergistically suppressed the proliferation and promoted the intrinsic apoptosis of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 impeded the ΔNp63-decreasing effects after metformin and 4SC-202 treatment, indicating that metformin and 4SC-202 could promote the degradation of ΔNp63 protein. Moreover, ubiquitination level of ΔNp63 increased after metformin or/and 4SC-202 administration. Furthermore, we revealed that ΔNp63 mediated anticancer effects of metformin and 4SC-202, as overexpression or suppression of ΔNp63 could attenuate or facilitate the apoptosis rate of OSCC under metformin or/and 4SC-202 treatment. Collectively, metformin and 4SC-202 synergistically promote intrinsic apoptosis through accelerating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ΔNp63 in OSCC, and this co-treatment can serve as a potential therapeutic scheme for OSCC.",

Statins and metformin have received considerable interest as potential chemopreventive agents against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, their impact on overall survival of patients with T2DM who later develop HCC (diabetic HCC patients) is unclear. Data on 2499 elderly diabetic HCC patients obtained from the SEER-Medicare program (2009 to 2013) were analyzed. Patients were categorized based on use of statins only, metformin only, both, or neither (reference for all comparisons). The patients were further categorized based on: (1) metformin dose: ≤1500 or >1500 mg/d; (2) statins functional form: hydrophilic (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) or lipophilic (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin); (3) statins potency: high (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) or low (fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin); and (4) individual statins type. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Prediagnosis use of metformin dose ≤1500 mg/d was associated with lower risk of death after HCC diagnosis in patients with T2DM (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), adjusting for postdiagnosis metformin dose, diabetes severity, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor characteristics, and other relevant factors. No association was found for prediagnosis metformin dose >1500 mg/d or postdiagnosis metformin use. Further, no association was found for either prediagnosis or postdiagnosis statins use. Prediagnosis use of metformin dose ≤1500 mg/d is associated with longer overall survival of elderly diabetic HCC patients.",

The Taiwan's National Health Insurance database was used to enroll 610,089 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients on at least 2 anti-diabetic prescriptions during 1999-2009. We followed-up these patients until 31 December 2011, in order to determine the incidence of leukemia. We used Cox regression model (incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment-weighting using propensity scores) to estimate hazard ratios in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We enrolled 414,783 metformin initiators and 195,306 non-metformin initiators. Among them, 598 and 372 patients developed new-onset leukemia after a median follow-up period of 5.08 years and 6.79 years, respectively. The respective incidence rates were 26.52 and 28.40 per 100,000 person-years. The hazard ratio for metformin initiators versus non-metformin initiators was 0.943 (95% confidence interval 0.828-1.074) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.852 (95% confidence interval 0.705-1.031) in the per-protocol analysis. Sensitivity analyses after excluding patients using the exclusion criteria (a follow-up duration < 24 and < 36 months, respectively, patients with incretin-based therapies during follow-up, and patients enrolled during 2 different periods of 1999-2003 and 2004-2009) consistently showed a neutral effect. However, metformin initiators had a significantly higher risk of leukemia in the per-protocol analyses when censoring patients at a time without regular follow-up. Metformin use has an overall neutral effect on leukemia but we cannot exclude a significantly higher risk in patients who persistently use the drug.",

Male participants were from Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (Australia) recruited between 2006 and 2009. Questionnaire and linked administrative health data from the Centre for Health Record Linkage and Services Australia were used to identify incident PC, healthcare utilisations, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing reimbursements and dispensing of metformin and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) prescriptions. Multivariable Cox and Joint Cox regression analyses were used to examine associations by cancer spread, adjusting for various confounders. Of 107,706 eligible men, 4257 developed incident PC up to end 2013. Risk of PC diagnosis increased with: PC family history (versus no family history of cancer; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.36; 95% CI:1.21-1.52); father and brother(s) diagnosed with PC (versus cancer-free family history; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 2.20; 95% CI:1.61-2.99); severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms (versus mild; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.77; 95% CI:1.53-2.04) and vasectomy (versus none; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.08; 95% CI:1.00-1.16).

To determine the current state of knowledge among European endocrinologists concerning the full spectrum of PCOS. An online survey comprising 41 items covering various aspects of PCOS diagnosis and management was distributed to members of the European Society of Endocrinology. A total of 505 European endocrinologists (64% females), with a mean age of 47 ± 11.6 years, participated in the survey. The Rotterdam criteria were the primary diagnostic tool for 85% of respondents. Most referrals (87.1%) occurred between ages 20 and 40 years. Twenty-five percent of physicians have access to mass spectrometry for the evaluation of androgen levels. While an extended metabolic profile was commonly employed as part of the workup, there was uncertainty regarding chronic anovulation diagnosis. Diabetes, including gestational or type 2, was recognized as a significant risk factor with universal screening irrespective of BMI status. Lifestyle modification and metformin were considered as standard interventions by all participants alongside oral contraceptives, though there was significant discrepancy in treatment duration. The Rotterdam diagnostic criteria are widely adopted for PCOS diagnosis among European endocrinologists. The current updated survey shows an emphasis on steroid profiling as an important part of diagnostic workup and a strong position held for recognition of PCOS as a metabolic condition with potentially serious implications. Current therapy thus shifted to the demand for prioritizing lifestyle interventions and metabolic therapies, either as monotherapy or in combination with standard hormone compounds.",

Propensity score stratified analyses confirmed that sildenafil is significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD across all four drug cohorts we tested (diltiazem, glimepiride, losartan and metformin) after adjusting age, sex, race, and disease comorbidities. We also found that sildenafil increases neurite growth and decreases phospho-tau expression in AD patient-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neuron models, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease. The association between sildenafil use and decreased incidence of AD does not establish causality or its direction, which requires a randomized clinical trial approach.",

      "abstract": "Metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mechanism appears to be suppression of protein translation via targeting the host mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. In the COVID-OUT randomized trial for outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), metformin reduced the odds of hospitalizations/death through 28 days by 58%, of emergency department visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days by 42%, and of long COVID through 10 months by 42%. COVID-OUT was a 2 × 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin; 999 participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs on day 1 (n = 945), day 5 (n = 871), and day 10 (n = 775). Viral load was quantified using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.05 to -.06; P = .027). Those who received metformin were less likely to have a detectable viral load than placebo at day 5 or day 10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, .55 to .94). Viral rebound, defined as a higher viral load at day 10 than day 5, was less frequent with metformin (3.28%) than placebo (5.95%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .36 to 1.29). The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and increased over time. Neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed effect over placebo. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2, metformin significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which may explain the clinical benefits in this trial. Metformin is pleiotropic with other actions that are relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology. NCT04510194.",

      "abstract": "Post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is an emerging chronic illness potentially affecting millions of people. We aimed to evaluate whether outpatient COVID-19 treatment with metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce the risk of long COVID. We conducted a decentralised, randomised, quadruple-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial (COVID-OUT) at six sites in the USA. We included adults aged 30-85 years with overweight or obesity who had COVID-19 symptoms for fewer than 7 days and a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR or antigen test within 3 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned via 2 × 3 parallel factorial randomisation (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive metformin plus ivermectin, metformin plus fluvoxamine, metformin plus placebo, ivermectin plus placebo, fluvoxamine plus placebo, or placebo plus placebo. Participants, investigators, care providers, and outcomes assessors were masked to study group assignment. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 by day 14, and those data have been published previously. Because the trial was delivered remotely nationwide, the a priori primary sample was a modified intention-to-treat sample, meaning that participants who did not receive any dose of study treatment were excluded. Long COVID diagnosis by a medical provider was a prespecified, long-term secondary outcome. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04510194. Between Dec 30, 2020, and Jan 28, 2022, 6602 people were assessed for eligibility and 1431 were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 1323 participants who received a dose of study treatment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, 1126 consented for long-term follow-up and completed at least one survey after the assessment for long COVID at day 180 (564 received metformin and 562 received matched placebo; a subset of participants in the metformin vs placebo trial were also randomly assigned to receive ivermectin or fluvoxamine). 1074 (95%) of 1126 participants completed at least 9 months of follow-up. 632 (56·1%) of 1126 participants were female and 494 (43·9%) were male; 44 (7·0%) of 632 women were pregnant. The median age was 45 years (IQR 37-54) and median BMI was 29·8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR 27·0-34·2). Overall, 93 (8·3%) of 1126 participants reported receipt of a long COVID diagnosis by day 300. The cumulative incidence of long COVID by day 300 was 6·3% (95% CI 4·2-8·2) in participants who received metformin and 10·4% (7·8-12·9) in those who received identical metformin placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·39-0·89; p=0·012). The metformin beneficial effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0·37 (95% CI 0·15-0·95). There was no effect on cumulative incidence of long COVID with ivermectin (HR 0·99, 95% CI 0·59-1·64) or fluvoxamine (1·36, 0·78-2·34) compared with placebo. Outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long COVID incidence by about 41%, with an absolute reduction of 4·1%, compared with placebo. Metformin has clinical benefits when used as outpatient treatment for COVID-19 and is globally available, low-cost, and safe.

Secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial. Not applicable. A total of 333 women with anovulatory infertility attributed to PCOS who participated in the double-blind randomized trial entitled the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome I (PPCOS I) study (registration number, NCT00068861) who had serum samples from baseline laboratory testing available for further serum analysis were studied. Not applicable. The association between the baseline AMH levels in each of the 3 treatment groups and ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth rates were assessed. A total of 322 individuals had a baseline AMH concentration available, of which the mean AMH was 11.7 ± 8.3 ng/mL (range 0.1-43.0 ng/mL). With each unit (1 ng/mL) increase in baseline AMH, the odds of ovulation decreased by 10% (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.93); this effect did not differ by treatment group. Women with a high baseline AMH concentration (>8 ng/mL) were significantly less likely to ovulate compared with those with a normal baseline AMH concentration (<4 ng/mL) (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.68). This remained statistically significant when controlling for confounders, including age, body mass index, time in study, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance score. Ovulation occurred even at very high AMH concentrations; there was no maximum level noted at which no ovulation events occurred. Baseline AMH concentration was not associated with pregnancy or live birth rates when controlling for confounders. These AMH values in well-phenotyped individuals with PCOS add to the literature and will aid in identifying AMH criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS. In women with infertility and PCOS, a higher AMH concentration was associated with reduced odds of ovulation with ovulation induction with clomiphene, clomiphene + metformin, and metformin. The original trial from which this analysis is derived was entitled \"Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A 30 Week Double-Blind Randomized Trial of Clomiphene Citrate, Metformin XR, and Combined Clomiphene Citrate/Metformin XR For the Treatment of Infertility in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\" and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as number NCT00068861. The URL for the trial is https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00068861. The first subject was enrolled in November 2002.",

Metformin and curcumin have shown promise in improving these metabolic and hormonal parameters individually, but their combined effects in PCOS remain unclear. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week factorial trial involving 200 women with PCOS. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive metformin (500-mg/8 h) + placebo, nanocurcumin soft gel capsule (80-mg/8 h) + placebo, metformin (500-mg/8 h) + nanocurcumin (80-mg/8 h), or double placebo. Lipid profiles, glucose metabolism markers, hormonal parameters, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and week 12. The combination of metformin and curcumin demonstrated significant improvements in lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, hormonal parameters, body weight, and BMI compared to individual agents or placebo. Greater reductions in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels were observed with the combination therapy, along with increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol. Additionally, the combination therapy significantly improved markers of glucose metabolism and showed synergistic effects in reducing body weight and BMI. Reductions in testosterone and improvements in Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were also observed with combination therapy. The combination of metformin and curcumin demonstrates superior efficacy in improving lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, hormonal parameters, body weight, and BMI in women with PCOS compared to individual agents or placebo. This highlights the potential synergistic effects of combining these agents for the management of PCOS.",

ART Clinic, AIIMS, New Delhi patients: 102 infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF cycles were enrolled after evaluating for eligibility and allotted as 50 in group 1 (Myo) and 52 in group 2 (Met) after randomization. Recruited patients received Myo 2 g twice daily (group 1) and Met 850 mg twice daily (group 2). Pre- and post-treatment clinical (menstrual pattern, BMI), hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin [PRL], and AMH), biochemical parameters (HOMA IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), ovarian with antral follicle count (AFC) and side effect profile were assessed. After 3 months of therapy, patients were recruited for IVF cycle by antagonist protocol was involving controlled ovarian stimulation, cycle monitoring, oocyte recovery, insemination of oocytes and follow up with fertilization, cleavage, transfer of good grade cleavage embryos, or blastocysts pregnancy outcomes and OHSS incidence and medications was continued until the day of OPU. Primary outcome was OHSS and clinical pregnancy rate including spontaneous, IVF, and cumulative pregnancy rate including FET.

Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of metformin in treating FAP and the association with intestinal flora. Compared with the baseline, the mean number and load of polyps in the areas of nanocarbon labeling and postoperative residuals in the test group were lower than those in the placebo group, while the diversity of intestinal flora species was increased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of g_Ruminococcus in the test group was lower than that at baseline, whereas the relative abundance of g_Lactobacillus was higher. These changes were statistically significant (P < 0.05). One-year metformin therapy for FAP is safe and effective, potentially mediated by modulating the intestinal flora. This study provides new insights and strategies for preventing adenomatous polyp carcinogenesis in FAP and explores possible preventive action.",

      "abstract": "Alpelisib (α-selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) plus fulvestrant is approved in multiple countries for men and postmenopausal women with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer following progression on or after endocrine therapy. A detailed understanding of alpelisib's safety profile should inform adverse event (AE) management and enhance patient care. AEs in the phase III SOLAR-1 trial were assessed in patients with and without PIK3CA mutations. The impact of protocol-specified AE-management recommendations was evaluated, including an amendment to optimize hyperglycemia and rash management. Patients were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus alpelisib (n = 284) or placebo (n = 287). The most common grade 3/4 AEs with alpelisib were hyperglycemia (grade 3, 32.7%; grade 4, 3.9%), rash (grade 3, 9.9%), and diarrhea (grade 3, 6.7%). Median time to onset of grade ≥3 toxicity was 15 days (hyperglycemia, based on fasting plasma glucose), 13 days (rash), and 139 days (diarrhea). Metformin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents was used by most patients (87.1%) with hyperglycemia. Preventive anti-rash medication resulted in lower incidence (any grade, 26.7% versus 64.1%) and severity of rash (grade 3, 11.6% versus 22.7%) versus no preventative medication. Discontinuations due to grade ≥3 AEs were lower following more-detailed AE management guidelines (7.9% versus 18.1% previously). Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a median alpelisib dose intensity of 248 mg/day. Median progression-free survival with alpelisib was 12.5 and 9.6 months for alpelisib dose intensities of ≥248 mg/day and <248 mg/day, respectively, compared with 5.8 months with placebo. Hyperglycemia and rash occurred early during alpelisib treatment, while diarrhea occurred at a later time point. Early identification, prevention, and intervention, including concomitant medications and alpelisib dose modifications, resulted in less severe toxicities. Reductions in treatment discontinuations and improved progression-free survival at higher alpelisib dose intensities support the need for optimal AE management. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02437318.",

We examined how alignment with the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Cancer Prevention Recommendations using the 2018 WCRF/AICR score was associated with incident lifestyle-related cancer in adults with prediabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP, 1996-2001) and DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS, 2002-2020), an observational follow-up of a randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to lifestyle, metformin, or placebo interventions (mean: 3 y) and followed for an additional 19 y. The 2018 WCRF/AICR score (0-7 points; higher score, better alignment) was calculated from body weight, physical activity, diet, and alcohol components at 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, and 15 y after randomization. Incident cancer was based on the 2018 WCRF/AICR 3rd Expert Report (18 cancers associated with lifestyle). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated associations between the score (baseline [0], change from 0 to 1 y, time dependent) and lifestyle-related cancer. Participants' (N = 3000) mean baseline WCRF/AICR score was 3.2 (SD: 1.1). There were 403 incident lifestyle-related cancer cases. Scores improved after 1 and 15 y (mean increase = 0.43 and 0.27 points, respectively, both P < 0.001). The baseline score was not associated with cancer risk. However, a 1-unit score improvement from 0 to 1 y and time-dependent scores were significantly associated with a 14% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.76, 0.97) and 9% (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.997) lower risk, respectively, with no effect modification by intervention group or diabetes status. In exploratory by-component analyses, no single component was associated with risk. Alignment with WCRF/AICR recommendations may lower cancer risk in adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of considering lifestyle factors for cancer prevention.

We investigated the association of T2D pPS with diabetes-related traits and T2D incidence in the Diabetes Prevention Program. We generated five T2D pPS (β-cell, proinsulin, liver/lipid, obesity, lipodystrophy) in 2,647 participants randomized to intensive lifestyle, metformin, or placebo arms. Associations were tested with general linear models and Cox regression with adjustment for age, sex, and principal components. Sensitivity analyses included adjustment for BMI. Higher β-cell pPS was associated with lower insulinogenic index and corrected insulin response at 1-year follow-up with adjustment for baseline measures (effect per pPS SD -0.04, P = 9.6 × 10-7, and -8.45 μU/mg, P = 5.6 × 10-6, respectively) and with increased diabetes incidence with adjustment for BMI at nominal significance (hazard ratio 1.10 per SD, P = 0.035). The liver/lipid pPS was associated with reduced 1-year baseline-adjusted triglyceride levels (effect per SD -4.37, P = 0.001). There was no significant interaction between T2D pPS and randomized groups. The remaining pPS were associated with baseline measures only. We conclude that despite interventions for diabetes prevention, participants with a high genetic burden of the β-cell cluster pPS had worsening in measures of β-cell function.",

      "abstract": "Remission of type 2 diabetes can occur as a result of weight loss and is characterised by liver fat and pancreas fat reduction and recovered insulin secretion. In this analysis, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of weight loss- induced remission in people with prediabetes. In this prespecified post-hoc analysis, weight loss-induced resolution of prediabetes in the randomised, controlled, multicentre Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS) was assessed, and the results were validated against participants from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study. For PLIS, between March 1, 2012, and Aug 31, 2016, participants were recruited from eight clinical study centres (including seven university hospitals) in Germany and randomly assigned to receive either a control intervention, a standard lifestyle intervention (ie, DPP-based intervention), or an intensified lifestyle intervention for 12 months. For DPP, participants were recruited from 23 clinical study centres in the USA between July 31, 1996, and May 18, 1999, and randomly assigned to receive either a standard lifestyle intervention, metformin, or placebo. In both PLIS and DPP, only participants who were randomly assigned to receive lifestyle intervention or placebo and who lost at least 5% of their bodyweight were included in this analysis. Responders were defined as people who returned to normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG; <5·6 mmol/L), normal glucose tolerance (<7·8 mmol/L), and HbA<sub>1c</sub> less than 39 mmol/mol after 12 months of lifestyle intervention or placebo or control intervention. Non-responders were defined as people who had FPG, 2 h glucose, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> more than these thresholds. The main outcomes for this analysis were insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) and were evaluated via linear mixed models. Of 1160 participants recruited to PLIS, 298 (25·7%) had weight loss of 5% or more of their bodyweight at baseline. 128 (43%) of 298 participants were responders and 170 (57%) were non-responders. Responders were younger than non-responders (mean age 55·6 years [SD 9·9] vs 60·4 years [8·6]; p<0·0001). The DPP validation cohort included 683 participants who lost at least 5% of their bodyweight at baseline. Of these, 132 (19%) were responders and 551 (81%) were non-responders. In PLIS, BMI reduction was similar between responders and non-responders (responders mean at baseline 32·4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [SD 5·6] to mean at 12 months 29·0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [4·9] vs non-responders 32·1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [5·9] to 29·2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [5·4]; p=0·86). However, whole-body insulin sensitivity increased more in responders than in non-responders (mean at baseline 291 mL/[min × m<sup>2</sup>], SD 60 to mean at 12 months 378 mL/[min × m<sup>2</sup>], 56 vs 278 mL/[min × m<sup>2</sup>], 62, to 323 mL/[min × m<sup>2</sup>], 66; p<0·0001), whereas insulin secretion did not differ within groups over time or between groups (responders mean at baseline 175 pmol/mmol [SD 64] to mean at 12 months 163·7 pmol/mmol [60·6] vs non-responders 158·0 pmol/mmol [55·6] to 154·1 pmol/mmol [56·2]; p=0·46). IHL decreased in both groups, without a difference between groups (responders mean at baseline 10·1% [SD 8·7] to mean at 12 months 3·5% [3·9] vs non-responders 10·3% [8·1] to 4·2% [4·2]; p=0·34); however, VAT decreased more in responders than in non-responders (mean at baseline 6·2 L [SD 2·9] to mean at 12 months 4·1 L [2·3] vs 5·7 L [2·3] to 4·5 L [2·2]; p=0·0003). Responders had a 73% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than non-responders in the 2 years after the intervention ended. By contrast to remission of type 2 diabetes, resolution of prediabetes was characterised by an improvement in insulin sensitivity and reduced VAT. Because return to normal glucose regulation (NGR) prevents development of type 2 diabetes, we propose the concept of remission of prediabetes in analogy to type 2 diabetes. We suggest that remission of prediabetes should be the primary therapeutic aim in individuals with prediabetes.

      "abstract": "Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug. Several studies have suggested that metformin has anticancer activity in some malignancies, including prostate cancer. Metformin might also mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). We hypothesised that metformin might improve survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and reduce metabolic complications associated with ADT. The STAMPEDE multi-arm, multi-stage, randomised phase 3 trial recruited patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate staged by conventional imaging with isotope bone and CT scanning. This publication reports findings for the most recent STAMPEDE research question, testing the addition of metformin to standard of care for non-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] <48 mmol/mol [equivalent to <6·5%]) patients with metastatic disease with adequate renal function (glomerular filtration rate ≥45 ml/min/1·73 m<sup>2</sup>) and WHO performance status 0-2. This trial recruited from 112 hospitals in the UK and Switzerland to the STAMPEDE protocol. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to standard of care or standard of care plus metformin 850 mg twice daily. Random assignment was by telephone using minimisation with a random element of 20% (developed and maintained by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL), stratified for randomising hospital, age (<70 years vs ≥70 years), WHO performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), type of ADT, regular long-term use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; yes vs no), pelvic nodal status (positive vs negative), planned radiotherapy (yes vs no), and planned docetaxel or androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) use (docetaxel vs abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide vs none). Standard of care comprised ADT with or without radiotherapy and with or without docetaxel or ARPI. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, defined as the time to death from any cause, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in patients who started treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00268476 and ISRCTN, ISRCTN78818544. Between Sep 5, 2016, and Mar 31, 2023, 1874 patients with metastatic disease were randomly allocated to standard of care (n=938) or standard of care plus metformin (n=936). The median patient age was 69 years (IQR 63-73) and the median PSA was 84 ng/mL (24-352). 1758 (94%) of 1874 patients were newly diagnosed with metastatic disease and 116 (6%) were diagnosed with metachronous relapsing disease. 1543 (82%) of 1874 patients received ADT plus docetaxel and 52 (3%) received abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide. The median time to most recent case report form follow-up was 60 months (IQR 49-72). 473 deaths were reported in the standard of care group; median survival was 61·8 months (IQR 29·7 to not reached). There were 453 deaths in the metformin group; median survival was 67·4 months (32·5 to not reached; HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·80-1·03; p=0·15). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 487 (52%) of 938 patients in the standard of care group and 523 (57%) of 921 patients in the standard of care plus metformin group. 61 (7%) patients in the standard of care group and 84 (9%) patients in the standard of care plus metformin group reported at least one grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal adverse event; all other body systems showed no difference in grade 3 adverse events. There were six drug-related deaths in the standard of care group and one in the standard of care plus metformin group. We did not find significant evidence of an overall survival benefit of adding metformin to standard of care in the overall population of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The side-effect profile of metformin was as expected and consisted mainly of diarrhoea. Adverse metabolic side-effects of ADT were significantly reduced in the metformin group compared with the standard of care group.

This study examined the effect of metformin treatment on the percentage of patients experiencing postoperative hyperglycemia after elective colon cancer surgery. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study was conducted at Slagelse Hospital in Slagelse, Denmark. Patients without diabetes planned for elective surgery for colon cancer were included. Patients received metformin (500 mg 3× per day) or placebo for 20 days before and 10 days after surgery. Blood glucose levels were measured several times daily until the end of postoperative day 2. The main outcome measures were the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 blood glucose measurement >7.7 and 10 mmol/L, respectively. Rates of complications within 30 days of surgery and Quality of Recovery-15 scores were also recorded. Of the 48 included patients, 21 patients (84.0%) in the placebo group and 18 patients (78.3%) in the metformin group had at least 1 blood glucose measurement >7.7 mmol/L ( p = 0.72), and 13 patients (52.0%) in the placebo group had a measurement >10.0 mmol/L versus 5 patients (21.7%) in the metformin group ( p = 0.04). No differences in complication rates or Quality of Recovery-15 scores were seen. The number of patients in the study was too low to detect a possible difference in postoperative complications. Blood glucose was measured as spot measurements instead of continuous surveillance. In patients without diabetes, metformin significantly reduced the percentage of patients experiencing postoperative hyperglycemia, as defined as spot blood glucose measurements >10 mmol/L after elective colon cancer surgery.

      "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). One strategy for overcoming resistance to EGFR inhibition is concomitant inhibition of downstream signaling. The antidiabetic drug metformin inhibits both MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. We evaluated the combination of erlotinib and metformin in a phase 1 study of patients with mTNBC. Patients with mTNBC who had received at least one prior line of therapy for metastatic disease were eligible. Erlotinib dose was fixed at 150 mg daily. Metformin dose escalation was planned according to a 3 + 3 design. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were assessed during the first 5 weeks of therapy. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of metformin with fixed-dose erlotinib. Secondary endpoints were response rate, stable disease rate, and progression-free survival. Eight patients were enrolled. The median number of prior therapies for metastatic disease was 2.5 (range, 1-6). No DLT events were reported during the DLT assessment period. Most adverse events were grade 1/2. Grade 3 diarrhea despite maximum supportive care required dose reduction of metformin in one patient. Grade 3 rash led to study withdrawal in one patient. No grade 4 adverse events were reported. The best observed response was stable disease in 2 patients (25%). Median progression-free survival was 60 days (range, 36-61 days). Erlotinib and metformin were well tolerated in a population of pretreated mTNBC patients but did not demonstrate efficacy in this population.",

We examined the link between antidiabetic medication use and prostate cancer survival taking into account simultaneous use of multiple drugs. The study cohort composed of 6,537 men in The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with prostate cancer diagnosed 1996 to 2009. Use of medication was attained from the nationwide prescription database of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Median follow-up was 9.2 years postdiagnosis. A total of 1,603 (24,5%) men had used antidiabetic medication. A total of 771 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to evaluate the risk of prostate cancer death and onset of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with adjustment for prostate cancer clinical characteristics, comorbidities and use of other drugs. Separate analyses were further adjusted for blood glucose. Risk of prostate cancer death was higher among antidiabetic drug users overall (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) compared with nonusers, separately among insulin and metformin users. Adjustment for blood glucose level abolished the risk increase. Risk of ADT initiation was increased among the medication users (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.49). Men with prostate cancer using antidiabetic medication are generally at increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with nonusers. The risk association is driven by underlying diabetes, as adjustment for blood glucose level ameliorates the risk increase. Type 2 diabetes should be considered as a risk factor when considering prostate cancer prognosis.",

From 1996 to 1999, 3,234 adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention, masked metformin, or placebo. Placebo and lifestyle interventions stopped in 2001, and a modified lifestyle program was offered to everyone, but unmasked study metformin continued in those originally randomized. Causes of deaths through 31 December 2018 were adjudicated by blinded reviews. All-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models and Fine-Gray models, respectively. Over a median of 21 years (interquartile range 20-21), 453 participants died. Cancer was the leading cause of death (<i>n</i> = 170), followed by cardiovascular disease (<i>n</i> = 131). Compared with placebo, metformin did not influence mortality from all causes (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.79, 1.25]), cancer (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.72, 1.52]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.70, 1.66]). Similarly, lifestyle modification did not impact all-cause (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.81, 1.28]), cancer (HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.74, 1.55]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.77, 1.81]) mortality. Analyses adjusted for diabetes status and duration, BMI, cumulative glycemic exposure, and cardiovascular risks yielded results similar to those for all-cause mortality. Cancer was the leading cause of mortality among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Although metformin and lifestyle modification prevented diabetes, neither strategy reduced all-cause, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality rates.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a known risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer and may increase risk for triple negative breast cancer in premenopausal women. Intervention strategies are clearly needed to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk. We conducted a Phase II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin in overweight/obese premenopausal women with components of metabolic syndrome to assess the potential of metformin for primary breast cancer prevention. Eligible participants were randomized to receive metformin (850 mg BID, n = 76) or placebo (n = 75) for 12 months. Outcomes included breast density, assessed by fat/water MRI with change in percent breast density as the primary endpoint, anthropometric measures, and intervention feasibility. Seventy-six percent in the metformin arm and 83% in the placebo arm (p = 0.182) completed the 12-month intervention. Adherence to study agent was high with more than 80% of participants taking ≥ 80% assigned pills. The most common adverse events reported in the metformin arm were gastrointestinal in nature and subsided over time. Compared to placebo, metformin intervention led to a significant reduction in waist circumference (p < 0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.019). Compared to placebo, metformin did not change percent breast density and dense breast volume but led to a numerical but not significant decrease in non-dense breast volume (p = 0.070). We conclude that metformin intervention resulted in favorable changes in anthropometric measures of adiposity and a borderline decrease in non-dense breast volume in women with metabolic dysregulation. More research is needed to understand the impact of metformin on breast cancer risk reduction. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02028221.

Study participants who completed their primary therapy and attained a clinically defined complete or partial response (PR) were treated with a planned 12 cycles of paclitaxel (135 mg/m² every 21 days) and metformin (850 mg twice daily) maintenance therapy. Thirty subjects received a median of 6 cycles (range, 5-6) of primary induction chemotherapy and were eligible for response evaluation; twenty-three patients exhibited a complete response, while 3 study patients obtained a PR (an overall response rate of 86.7%). Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity included neutropenia (43.3%), thrombocytopenia (10%) and anemia (36.7%). There was no incidence of grade 3-4 neuropathy although 15 patients (50%) developed grade ≤2 neurotoxicity. Additionally, we observed grade ≤2 diarrhea in 20 (66.7%) subjects. The median progression-free survival was 21 months (range, 3-52) and overall median survival was 35 months (range, 15-61). The subjects also received an aggregate 103 cycles (median, 12; range, 6-12) of maintenance chemotherapy.

We sought to determine the effects of behavioral weight loss and metformin treatment on SU in a randomized trial. <b>Methods and Findings:</b> The Survivorship Promotion In Reducing IGF-1 Trial (SPIRIT) was a parallel three-arm randomized controlled trial of overweight/obese adult cancer survivors without gout at a single center in Maryland, United States. Participants were randomized to: (1) coach-directed weight loss (behavioral telephonic coaching), (2) metformin (up to 2000 mg daily), or (3) self-directed weight loss (informational brochures; reference group). SU and BMI were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. The 121 participants had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 60 ± 9 years, 79% were female, and 45% were Black. At baseline, BMI was 35 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and SU was 5.6 ± 1.3 mg/dL. Compared to the self-directed group, at 12 months, the coach-directed group reduced BMI by 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.5, -0.4) and metformin reduced BMI by 0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -1.1, -0.1). However, compared to the self-directed group, the coach-directed group unexpectedly increased SU by 0.3 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.05, 0.6), and metformin non-significantly increased SU by 0.2 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.04, 0.5); these effects were attenuated when analyses included change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). <b>Conclusions:</b> In this randomized trial of cancer survivors without gout, reductions in BMI either increased or did not change SU, potentially due to effects on eGFR. These results do not support a focus on BMI reduction for SU reduction; however, long-term studies are needed. <b>ClinicalTrials.gov Registration</b>: NCT02431676.",

Objective We investigated the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination of copanlisib, an intravenous, pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients in a phase I dose-escalation trial. Patients and methods Copanlisib was given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles at the dose of 45 mg and 30 mg, in combination with standard doses of weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> loading dose followed by 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 8, 15, and 22, and weekly thereafter). Results Three patients received copanlisib 45 mg, of whom two experienced grade 3 hyperglycemia during Cycle 1 that met the DLT criteria. Eight patients were then treated with copanlisib at the dose of 30 mg. Because of the occurrence of hyperglycemia, a premedication with metformine was introduced on the day of the injections. No DLTs were reported at this dose level. The trial was stopped early because of the unfavourable toxicity profile of the combination. Among eight evaluable patients for response, four patients (50%) had disease stabilization according to RECIST1.1 as best response. Conclusion Copanlisib combined with cetuximab demonstrated unfavorable toxicity and limited efficacy in heavily pretreated recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients.Trial registration NCT02822482, Date of registration: June 2016.",

Serum TT, DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, FT, FAI, body fat, and body fat percentage were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant changes in serum TT, SHBG, and FAI were observed in all treatment groups compared with baseline. DHEA-S and androstenedione significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups after treatment. FT only significantly decreased in the DOM group. Body fat and body fat percentage significantly decreased in the DO and DOM groups. Compared with the D group, DHEA-S significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups (F = 4.081, p = 0.008); SHBG significantly increased in the DOM group (F = 3.019, p = 0.031); and FAI significantly decreased in the DO group (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.578, p = 0.006). There were significant differences between groups in body fat percentage (χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.590, p < 0.001). Side-effects were less with orlistat than metformin. Diane-35 in combination with orlistat or metformin is more effective in reducing androgen than Diane-35 alone. Orlistat is more effective in reducing body fat percentage than metformin. In addition, orlistat has mild side-effects and is better tolerated compared with metformin.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies and cardiovascular prevention trials have shown that low-dose aspirin can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, including inhibition of distant metastases. Metformin has also been associated with decreased colon adenoma recurrence in clinical trials and lower CRC incidence and mortality in epidemiological studies in diabetics. While both drugs have been tested as single agents, their combination has not been tested in cancer prevention trials. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2 × 2 biomarker trial of aspirin and metformin to test the activity of either agent alone and the potential synergism of their combination on a set of surrogate biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis. After surgery, 160 patients with stage I-III CRC are randomly assigned in a four-arm trial to either aspirin (100 mg day), metformin (850 mg bis in die), their combination, or placebo for one year. The primary endpoint biomarker is the change of IHC expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) in the unaffected mucosa of proximal and distal colon obtained by multiple biopsies in two paired colonoscopies one year apart. Additional biomarkers will include: 1) the measurement of circulating IL-6, CRP and VEGF; 2) the IHC expression of tissue pS6K, p53, beta-catenin, PI3K; 3) the associations of genetic markers with treatment response as assessed by next generation sequencing of primary tumors; 4) the genomic profile of candidate genes, pathways, and overall genomic patterns in tissue biopsies by genome wide gene expression arrays; and 5) the evaluation of adenoma occurrence at 1 year. A favorable biomarker modulation by aspirin and metformin may provide important clues for a subsequent phase III adjuvant trial aimed at preventing second primary cancer, delaying recurrence and improving prognosis in patients with CRC.

A total of 1,442 participants were randomly assigned to one of four interventions: 1) MET (1,700 mg/day) plus MedDiet intervention (MET+MedDiet); 2) placebo plus MedDiet intervention; 3) MET (1,700 mg/day) alone; and 4) placebo alone. Participants were followed up for 3 years on average. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of major noncommunicable diseases (including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the changing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The crude incidence of the major noncommunicable diseases was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years in the MET+MedDiet group, 6.9 in the MET alone group, 13.3 in the placebo plus MedDiet group, and 11.3 in the placebo group. The differences were fully explained by the reduction of type 2 diabetes, which was 80% and 92% lower in the MET and MET+MedDiet groups, respectively, compared with placebo. The use of 1,700 mg/day MET is effective to prevent diabetes in people selected on the basis of metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is used to reduce pregnancy complications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), although it is not approved for this indication and solid evidence is lacking. Midpregnancy Doppler ultrasound is one of the best methods for prediction of adverse pregnancy outcome. The objectives of the study were to investigate the following: 1) whether metformin treatment influenced the midpregnancy pulsatility index (PI) of the uterine artery; 2) whether metabolic or endocrine factors affect the PI of the uterine artery of PCOS women; and 3) whether PI predicted adverse pregnancy outcome in PCOS woman. This is a substudy of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study conducted at 11 secondary care centers. We randomly assigned 273 pregnancies to receive metformin or placebo, from the first trimester of pregnancy to delivery. In the present substudy, 231 pregnancies are included, ie, those who completed the ultrasound examinations. Midpregnancy PI in the uterine artery related to metformin use, androgen levels, an oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin levels was measured. We found no difference in the PI between the metformin and placebo groups. In multivariate analyses, fasting serum glucose of the first and second trimester correlated positively to the midpregnancy PI. Only in univariate analyses a weak correlation between androstenedione and PI was seen. Metformin treatment did not affect uterine artery blood flow, measured by PI. High fasting blood glucose correlated inversely to uterine artery blood flow. The midpregnancy PI correlated positively to preeclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes mellitus in PCOS pregnancies. Androgen levels correlated only to PI in univariate analyses.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical and retrospective studies suggested a role for metformin in sensitizing patients who have diabetes with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We therefore examined its effects in combination with gefitinib in patients without diabetes harboring EGFR mutations (EGFRm). A total of 224 patients without diabetes with treatment-naïve stage IIIB-IV EGFRm NSCLC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gefitinib plus either metformin or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Serum levels of IL6 were also examined in an exploratory analysis. The median duration of follow-up was 19.15 months. The estimated 1-year PFS rates were 41.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30.0-52.2] with gefitinib plus metformin and 42.9% (95% CI, 32.6-52.7) with gefitinib plus placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.6268). Median PFS (10.3 months vs. 11.4 months) and median OS (22.0 months vs. 27.5 months) were numerically lower in the metformin group, while ORRs were similar between the two arms (66% vs. 66.7%). No significant treatment group differences were detected across all subgroups with respect to PFS, including those with elevated levels of IL6. Metformin combined with gefitinib resulted in a remarkably higher incidence of diarrhea compared with the control arm (78.38% vs. 43.24%). Our study showed that addition of metformin resulted in nonsignificantly worse outcomes and increased toxicity and hence does not support its concurrent use with first-line EGFR-TKI therapy in patients without diabetes with EGFRm NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evidence-based practice. However, RCTs can have limitations. For example, translation of findings into practice can be limited by design features, such as inclusion criteria, not accurately reflecting clinical populations. In addition, it is expensive to recruit and follow-up participants in RCTs. Linkage with routinely collected data could offer a cost-effective way to enhance the conduct and generalisability of RCTs. The aim of this study is to investigate how primary care data can support RCTs. Secondary analysis following linkage of two datasets: 1) multicentre CHHiP radiotherapy trial (ISRCTN97182923) and 2) primary care database from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre. Comorbidities and medications recorded in CHHiP at baseline, and radiotherapy-related toxicity recorded in CHHiP over time were compared with primary care records. The association of comorbidities and medications with toxicity was analysed with mixed-effects logistic regression. Primary care records were extracted for 106 out of 2811 CHHiP participants recruited from sites in England (median age 70, range 44 to 82). Complementary information included longitudinal body mass index, blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as baseline smoking and alcohol usage but was limited by the considerable missing data. In the linked sample, 9 (8%) participants were recorded in CHHiP as having a history of diabetes and 38 (36%) hypertension, whereas primary care records indicated incidence prior to trial entry of 11 (10%) and 40 (38%) respectively. Concomitant medications were not collected in CHHiP but available in primary care records. This indicated that 44 (41.5%) men took aspirin, 65 (61.3%) statins, 14 (13.2%) metformin and 46 (43.4%) phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors at some point before or after trial entry. We provide a set of recommendations on linkage and supplementation of trials. Data recorded in primary care are a rich resource and linkage could provide near real-time information to supplement trials and an efficient and cost-effective mechanism for long-term follow-up. In addition, standardised primary care data extracts could form part of RCT recruitment and conduct. However, this is at present limited by the variable quality and fragmentation of primary care data.",

This study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with metformin, saxagliptin, and their combination in newly diagnosed women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome in China. A total of 75 newly diagnosed patients from Shanghai, China with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome were included in this randomized, parallel, open-label study. All patients received treatment for 24 weeks with metformin, saxagliptin, or their combination. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups by a computer-generated code that facilitated equal patient distribution of 25 patients per group. The primary outcome was a change in glycemic control and β-cell function. A total of 63 patients completed the study (n = 21, for each group). The reduction in hemoglobin A1c was significant in the combination group, compared to the monotherapy groups (saxagliptin vs. combination treatment vs. metformin: - 1.1 vs. -1.3 vs. -1.1%, P = 0.016), whereas it was comparable between the metformin and saxagliptin groups (P > 0.05). Saxagliptin, metformin, and the combination treatment significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment- insulin resistance index and increased the deposition index (P < 0.01 for all). However, no significant change was observed in the homeostasis model assessment- β-cell function among the metformin and combination groups, and no significant changes were observed in the insulinogenic index among all three groups (P > 0.05 for all). In addition, saxagliptin and metformin treatments significantly reduced body mass index and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.01 for both). Saxagliptin and metformin were comparably effective in regulating weight loss, glycemic control, and β-cell function, improving lipid profiles, and reducing inflammation in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      "abstract": "The best treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes in whom treatment with metformin alone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control is debated. We aimed to compare the long-term effects of pioglitazone versus sulfonylureas, given in addition to metformin, on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. TOSCA.IT was a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic clinical trial, in which patients aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy (2-3 g per day) were recruited from 57 diabetes clinics in Italy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by permuted blocks randomisation (block size 10), stratified by site and previous cardiovascular events, to add-on pioglitazone (15-45 mg) or a sulfonylurea (5-15 mg glibenclamide, 2-6 mg glimepiride, or 30-120 mg gliclazide, in accordance with local practice). The trial was unblinded, but event adjudicators were unaware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was a composite of first occurrence of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or urgent coronary revascularisation, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants with baseline data available and without any protocol violations in relation to inclusion or exclusion criteria). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700856. Between Sept 18, 2008, and Jan 15, 2014, 3028 patients were randomly assigned and included in the analyses. 1535 were assigned to pioglitazone and 1493 to sulfonylureas (glibenclamide 24 [2%], glimepiride 723 [48%], gliclazide 745 [50%]). At baseline, 335 (11%) participants had a previous cardiovascular event. The study was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis after a median follow-up of 57·3 months. The primary outcome occurred in 105 patients (1·5 per 100 person-years) who were given pioglitazone and 108 (1·5 per 100 person-years) who were given sulfonylureas (hazard ratio 0·96, 95% CI 0·74-1·26, p=0·79). Fewer patients had hypoglycaemias in the pioglitazone group than in the sulfonylureas group (148 [10%] vs 508 [34%], p<0·0001). Moderate weight gain (less than 2 kg, on average) occurred in both groups. Rates of heart failure, bladder cancer, and fractures were not significantly different between treatment groups. In this long-term, pragmatic trial, incidence of cardiovascular events was similar with sulfonylureas (mostly glimepiride and gliclazide) and pioglitazone as add-on treatments to metformin. Both of these widely available and affordable treatments are suitable options with respect to efficacy and adverse events, although pioglitazone was associated with fewer hypoglycaemia events.

A randomised, single-centre, open-label, controlled trial conducted between October 2013 and December 2017. Shanghai OBGYN Hospital of Fudan University, China. A total of 150 patients (18-45 years old) with primary AEH or well-differentiated EEC were randomised into an MA group (n = 74) and an MA plus metformin group (n = 76). Patients with AEH or EEC were firstly stratified, then randomised to receive MA (160 mg orally, daily) or MA (160 mg orally, daily) plus metformin (500 mg orally, three times a day). The primary efficacy parameter was the cumulate complete response (CR) rate within 16 weeks of treatment (16w-CR rate); the secondary efficacy parameters were 30w-CR rate and adverse events. The 16w-CR rate was higher in the metformin plus MA group than in the MA-only group (34.3 versus 20.7%, odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-4.51, P = 0.09) but the difference was more significant in 102 AEH patients (39.6 versus 20.4%, OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.06-6.21, P = 0.04). This effect of metformin was also significant in non-obese (51.4 versus 24.3%, OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.22-8.84, P = 0.02) and insulin-sensitive (54.8 versus 28.6%, OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.03-8.97, P = 0.04) subgroups of AEH women. No significant result was found in secondary endpoints. As a fertility-sparing treatment, metformin plus MA was associated with a higher early CR rate compared with MA alone in AEH patients. For AEH patients, metformin plus MA might be a better fertility-sparing treatment to achieve a higher early CR rate compared with MA alone.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and thyroid disorders have both been linked to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Even small variations in thyroid function within the normal range may influence fetal growth. Our aim was to investigate whether maternal thyroid function is associated with newborn anthropometrics in PCOS and explore the potential modifying effect of metformin. <i>Post-hoc</i> analyses of two RCTs in which pregnant women with PCOS were randomized to metformin or placebo, from first trimester to delivery. Maternal serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) were measured at gestational weeks (gw) 5-12, 19, 32 and 36 in 309 singleton pregnancies. The mean z-scores of birthweight, birth length, and head circumference were estimated in the offspring. Associations of maternal thyroid parameters with offspring anthropometrics and the outcomes large for gestational age (LGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) were studied using linear and logistic regression models, with adjustment for body mass index (BMI) when relevant. Maternal fT4 at baseline was negatively associated with birth length (b= -0.09, p=0.048). Furthermore, ΔfT4 during pregnancy correlated positively to z-score of both birth weight and length (b=0.10, p=0.017 and b=0.10, p=0.047 respectively), independently of treatment group. TSH at baseline and gw19 was inversely associated with LGA (OR 0.47, p=0.012 and OR 0.58, p=0.042), while ΔTSH was positively associated with LGA (OR 1.99, p=0.023). There were inverse associations between TSH at baseline and SGA (OR 0.32, p=0.005) and between ΔfT4 and SGA (OR 0.59, p=0.005) in the metformin group only. There were no associations between maternal thyroid function and head circumference of the newborns. In women with PCOS, a higher maternal fT4 in early pregnancy and a greater decrease in fT4 during pregnancy was associated with a lower offspring birthweight and shorter birth length. Higher TSH by mid-gestation and smaller increase in TSH during pregnancy was associated with less risk of LGA. Subclinical variations in maternal thyroid function might play a role for birth anthropometrics of PCOS offspring.",

TRAMP mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet group, HFD group and metformin-HFD (Met-HFD) group. Mortality rate and tumor formation rate were examined. TRAMP mice were sacrificed and sampled on the 20th, 24(th), and 28th week, respectively. Serum levels of insulin and IGF-1 were tested by ELISA.

A total of 17 deaths of TRAMP mice were observed, including 3 (10 %) from the normal diet group, 10 (33.33 %) from the HFD group, and 4 (13.33 %) from Met-HFD group. The mortality rate of TRAMP mice from HFD group was significantly higher than that of normal diet group (P = 0.028), and metformin could moderately decrease the mortality rate by 60.01 % (P = 0.067). Tumor formation rates were not significantly different among the three groups. Levels of glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 tended to increase with TRAMP mice's age in HFD group. TRAMP mice from HFD group had higher serum insulin and IGF-1 levels. A moderate decrease in IGF-1 was also seen in Met-HFD group. HFD could promote TRAMP mouse PCa development and progression and metformin had moderate effect of reducing PCa mortality rate with a decrease in serum IGF-1 level.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is widely prescribed to pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an attempt to reduce pregnancy complications. Metformin is not approved for this indication, and evidence for this practice is lacking. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that metformin, from first trimester to delivery, reduces pregnancy complications in women with PCOS. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study at 11 secondary care centers. The participants were 257 women with PCOS, in the first trimester of pregnancy, aged 18-42 yr. We randomly assigned 274 singleton pregnancies (in 257 women) to receive metformin or placebo, from first trimester to delivery. The prevalence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm delivery, and a composite of these three outcomes is reported. Preeclampsia prevalence was 7.4% in the metformin group and 3.7% in the placebo group (3.7%; 95% CI, -1.7-9.2) (P=0.18). Preterm delivery prevalence was 3.7% in the metformin group and 8.2% in the placebo group (-4.4%; 95%, CI, -10.1-1.2) (P=0.12). Gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence was 17.6% in the metformin group and 16.9% in the placebo group (0.8%; 95% CI, -8.6-10.2) (P=0.87). The composite primary endpoint prevalence was 25.9 and 24.4%, respectively (1.5%; 95% CI, -8.9-11.3) (P=0.78). Women in the metformin group gained less weight during pregnancy compared with those in the placebo group. There was no difference in fetal birth weight between the groups. Metformin treatment from first trimester to delivery did not reduce pregnancy complications in PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is implicated in human cancer growth and progression. Agents targeting this pathway are associated with hyperglycemia due to interaction with the insulin-glucose regulatory axis. Identifying the predictive factors for hyperglycemia in patients treated with these agents may help direct future management. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients treated consecutively with PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitors in the Drug Development Unit, The Royal Marsden (RM) National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, between 2007 and 2012 were recorded. Baseline variables and their association with grade 3 hyperglycemia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) were analyzed by using the chi-square test and Fisher exact test for categorical variables and binary logistic regression for continuous variables. A total of 341 patients were treated in 12 phase I trials of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, and 298 patients (87.4%) developed hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia was grade 1 in 217 (72.8%) and grade 2 in 61 (20.5%) patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 hyperglycemia was seen in 6.7% of patients (n = 20). According to the chi-square test, age <65 years (p = .03), history of diabetes (p = .003), and treatment with AKT and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (p < .0005) predicted the occurrence of grade 3 hyperglycemia. Of 24 patients requiring intervention, 20 received metformin, 2 dietary advice, 1 insulin, and 1 both metformin and insulin. One patient required dose reduction. There were no permanent drug discontinuations, and no hyperglycemia-related dose-limiting toxicities were observed; thus, the recommended phase II dose was not affected by the hyperglycemia observed in our cohort. Hyperglycemia is common in patients treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors; however, it is manageable with conventional treatment. Predictive factors of age, history of diabetes, and administration of AKT and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors warrant prospective validation. This study reviewed the clinical data of 341 patients treated in 12 phase I trials of agents targeting phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3), protein kinase B (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as dual inhibitors. Hyperglycemia was evident in 87.4% of patients but was ≥grade 3 in just 6.7%. Age <65 years, history of diabetes, and treatment with AKT and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were each associated with grade 3 hyperglycemia. Management of patients was uncomplicated, and no permanent drug discontinuations were necessary. Despite the small study size, these findings support continued caution about enrolling patients with a history of diabetes into such trials. However, clinicians may be reassured, pending prospective validation of these results, that significant hyperglycemia is not frequent and, when it occurs, is manageable.",

Changes in weight, papilledema, headache, visual fields, and overall life status were prospectively assessed in response to 6 to 14 months on 2.25 g/day MET-diet or diet alone in 36 women with IIH, 23 with PCOS, selected by baseline body mass index (BMI) > or = 25, and no previous surgery for IIH. Overall life status was graded using a self-reported 1-5 scale (1 = well, normal activities; 2 = unwell, usual activities; 3 = poor, usual activities; 4 = poor, no usual activities; 5 = totally disabled). Conventional treatment for IIH was maintained unchanged during MET-diet intervention. The diet was hypocaloric (1500 calories/day), high protein (26% of calories), and low carbohydrate (44%). Of the 23 women with PCOS, 20 received MET-diet and 3 diet only (could not tolerate MET). Of the 13 women without PCOS, 7 were hyperinsulinemic and received MET-diet and 6 received diet alone. The 3 treatment groups (diet only [n = 9], PCOS-MET-diet [n = 20], and hyperinsulinemia-MET-diet [n = 7]) did not differ by median entry BMI (33.3, 37.6, and 35.7 kg/m(2)) or by duration of treatment (10.2, 11.4, and 10.9 months). Median percent weight loss was greatest in the PCOS-MET group (7.7%, P = 0.0015), was 3.3% in the diet only group, and 2.4% (P = 0.04) in the hyperinsulinemia-MET group. Papilledema significantly improved in the diet-alone group from 100% at baseline to 13% (P = 0.03), and in the PCOS-MET group from 95% to 30% (P = 0.002). If headache persisted on therapy, it was less intense-less frequent (P = 0.03) in the diet-only group and in the PCOS-MET group (P = 0.04). As many women with IIH have PCOS, and because weight loss is central to IIH treatment, diet-MET is a novel approach to treat IIH in women with concurrent PCOS or hyperinsulinemia without PCOS.",

Omega-3 fatty acids had neutral effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The ORIGIN and Legacy Effects (ORIGINALE) study measured posttrial effects of these interventions during an additional 2.7 years. Surviving ORIGIN participants attended up to two additional visits. The hazard of clinical outcomes during the entire follow-up period from randomization was calculated. Of 12,537 participants randomized, posttrial data were analyzed for 4,718 originally allocated to insulin glargine (2,351) versus standard care (2,367), and 4,771 originally allocated to omega-3 fatty acid supplements (2,368) versus placebo (2,403). Posttrial, small differences in median HbA1c persisted (glargine 6.6% [49 mmol/mol], standard care 6.7% [50 mmol/mol], P = 0.025). From randomization to the end of posttrial follow-up, no differences were found between the glargine and standard care groups in myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (1,185 vs. 1,165 events; hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.94-1.10]; P = 0.72); myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure (1,958 vs. 1,910 events; 1.03 [0.97-1.10]; P = 0.38); or any cancer (524 vs. 529 events; 0.99 [0.88-1.12]; P = 0.91) or between omega-3 and placebo groups in cardiovascular death (688 vs. 700; 0.98 [0.88-1.09]; P = 0.68) or other outcomes.

However, our knowledge of the effects of metformin on breast cancer recurrence is limited. Within the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase II trial MetBreCS, we examined changes in breast tissue from breast cancer survivors with BMI > 25 kg/m2 after treatment with metformin. To identify metformin-regulated signaling pathways, we integrated the transcriptomic, metabolomic and steroid hormone profiles using bivariate and functional analyses. We identified MS4A1, HBA2, MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2, EGFL6 and FDCSP expression to be differentially expressed in breast tissues from metformin-treated postmenopausal women. The integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles revealed down-regulation of immune response genes associated with reduced levels of arginine and citrulline in the metformin-treated group. The integration of transcriptomic and steroid hormone profiles showed an enrichment of steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism pathways with highly negatively correlated CYP11A1 and CYP1B1 expression in breast tissue from postmenopausal metformin-treated women. Our results indicate that postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with metformin have specific changes in breast tissue gene expression that may prevent the development of new tumors.Trial registration: MetBreCs trial is registered at European Union Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT Protocol # 2015-001001-14) on 07/10/2015.",

In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, normoglycemic patients with PCa planned for at least 9 months of ADT were randomized 2:1 to receive metformin 850 mg or placebo twice daily orally for 18 months. The primary objective was to compare proportions of MS at 18 months between the study arms. Between July 2018 and November 2023, 166 patients were randomized. The trial closed prematurely on November 24, 2023, because of drug supply cessation and the planned enrollment numbers (n = 300) were not met. A total of 90 (metformin) and 45 patients (placebo) were analyzed in the final analysis. The median follow-up was 24 months (IQR: 19.5-36 months). Proportions of MS between metformin and placebo arms were 38/90 (42%) vs 26/45 (58%) at baseline (<i>P</i> = .09) and 40/73 (55%) vs 23/34 (68%) at 18 months (<i>P</i> = .2). Significant reductions in mean (SD) body weight occurred with metformin at 9 (-0.9 [4] vs +1.8 [3.8] kg; <i>P</i> < .001) and 12 months (-0.33 [3.9] vs +1.8 [3.9] kg; <i>P</i> = .004). Mean (SD) hemoglobin A1c was lowered with metformin at 9% (-0.02% [0.23%] vs +0.08% [0.26%]; <i>P</i> = .02) and 12 months (+0.03% [0.27%] vs +0.08% [0.27%]; <i>P</i> = .03). Significantly smaller increments in mean (SD) waist circumferences were noted with metformin at 9 (+0.8 [4.3] vs +2.9 [5.7] cm; <i>P</i> = .03), 12 (+1.9 [5.1] vs +3.3 [6] cm; <i>P</i> = .15), and 18 months (+1.8 [3.8] vs +3.8 [6.1] cm; <i>P</i> = .03). Metformin did not reduce the risk of MS in patients with PCa on ADT. However, significant improvements in body weight, waist circumference, and hemoglobin A1c suggest a potential role for metformin in reducing ADT-related complications.",

However, the anti-cancer effect of metformin for diabetic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver resection remains unclear. The aim of our cohort study was to assess whether metformin influence the recurrence of HCC. We retrospectively enrolled 857 HCC patients who received primary resection from April 2001 to June 2016. 222 patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) from medical record. Factors influence the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by multivariate analysis. During the follow-up period (mean, 75 months), 471 (54.9%) patients experienced recurrence, and 158 (18.4%) patients died. Multivariate analysis revealed that DM (p = 0.015), elevated AST (p = 0.006), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.003), tumor number (p = 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), vascular invasion (p <0.001), high Ishak fibrosis score (p <0.001), hepatitis B (p = 0.014), hepatitis C (p = 0.001) were independent predictors for RFS. In diabetic patients, only HbA1c>9% (p = 0.033), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.030) and vascular invasion (p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence; but the metformin use revealed no significance on recurrence. DM is a risk factor of HCC recurrence after resection. Adequate DM control can reduce the recurrence of HCC. However, the use of metformin does not reduce the risk of HCC recurrence in diabetic patient after initial resection. Hence, metformin may not have protective influences on HCC recurrence in diabetic patients who undergo initial liver resection.",

Prospective randomized study. University Hospital endocrinology outpatient clinic. Young women with PCOS (aged 23.3±4.9 years). Patients were assigned randomly to no treatment (n=14), metformin 850 mg two times per day (n=15), and pioglitazone 30 mg daily (n=14) for 6 months. Healthy age- and body mass index-matched women served as controls (n=14). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was studied at baseline and 6 months. Women with PCOS had higher insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices and lower flow-mediated dilation compared with controls. The three groups of women with PCOS did not differ at baseline. No differences were observed at follow-up in women who received no treatment. Metformin and pioglitazone improved flow-mediated dilation to a similar extent, restoring it to normal values at 6 months. Both insulin sensitizers induced favorable changes in insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices in women with PCOS. Independent predictors of flow-mediated dilation improvement at 6 months were treatment with insulin sensitizers and reduction in insulin resistance. In young women with PCOS, treatment with metformin or pioglitazone for 6 months induces a similar beneficial effect on endothelial function; this may be partially attributed to an improvement in insulin resistance. Further research is needed to investigate whether treatment with insulin sensitizers in women with PCOS also reduces cardiovascular risk.",

Our objective was to explore whether metabolic syndrome had an effect on overall female fertility and in vitro fertilization outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial in 1508 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which was originally designed to compare the live birth rate after fresh-embryo transfer vs frozen embryo transfer (Frefro-PCOS). At baseline, metabolic parameters, including body mass index, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting, and 2 hour glucose and insulin levels after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test were measured. All subjects were divided into a metabolic syndrome group (metabolic syndrome) and absence of metabolic syndrome group (nonmetabolic syndrome) according to diagnostic criteria. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models tested the association between metabolic syndrome and overall fertility and in vitro fertilization cycle stimulation characteristics and clinical outcomes. Metabolic syndrome was identified in 410 of 1508 infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (27.2%). Patients with metabolic syndrome had longer infertility duration (4.0 ± 2.2 vs 3.7 ± 2.2, P = .004) compared with those without metabolic syndrome. During ovarian stimulation, those with metabolic syndrome required significantly higher and longer doses of gonadotropin and had lower peak estradiol level, fewer retrieved oocytes, available embryos, a lower oocyte utilization rate, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome than those with nonmetabolic syndrome. The cumulative live birth rate did not show a significant between-group difference (57.8% vs 62.2%, P = .119). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of infertility, body mass index, thyroid-stimulating hormone, metabolic syndrome group, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, metformin utilization, number of available embryos, and embryos transferred showed that the number of embryos transferred and the number of available embryos were positively but metabolic syndrome negatively associated with the cumulative live birth rate (odds ratio, 2.18, 1.10, and 0.70, respectively, P < .05). Women with polycystic ovary syndrome with metabolic syndrome have a negative impact from female fecundity, and this suggests an adverse effect on in vitro fertilization cycle stimulation characteristics and clinical outcomes.",

We administered metformin (1500 mg per day) to 32 women with early breast cancer whose baseline insulin levels were at least 45 pmol/L to determine its effect on insulin levels. Twenty-two (69%) women completed the 6-month intervention. Four women (12.5%) dropped out because of gastrointestinal side effects; the others withdrew for reasons not related to toxicity. Completers were similar to noncompleters for all baseline characteristics apart from global health, overall physical condition, overall quality of life, physical function, and social function (HRQOL), which was decreased in noncompleters. Metformin significantly lowered fasting insulin levels by 15.8 pmol/L (22.4%; P=.024) and improved insulin sensitivity by 25.6% (P=.018), total cholesterol by 5.3%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9.1%. Metformin reduced weight by 1.9 kg (2.5%; P=.01), and it had no significant effects on HRQOL or specific gastrointestinal symptoms (appetite, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation). Metformin significantly lowers insulin levels, and it improves insulin resistance in nondiabetic women with breast cancer. A phase III randomized trial to evaluate its effects on breast cancer outcomes is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, complex endocrine disorder for women on reproductive age. A high incidence of ovulation failure is observed in PCO women and perhaps linked to insulin resistance related to metabolic features In the last few years some studies assessed hyperinsulinimea and insulin resistance attenuation effects, by insulin sensitizing agents such as metformin, in PCOS women suggesting potential scope for these drugs in CC ovulation induction quality improvement. Our prospective study aim is to compare the effectiveness of clomifene citrate plus metformin and clomifene citrate plus placebo in women with newly diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome. From February 24 to September 29 (2007), PCOS was explored on women attending the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology sterility consultation unit (CHU Hedi Chaker-Sfax) according to the Rotterdam 2003 diagnostic criteria. PCOS patients were randomized to receive, in addition to clomifene citrate treatment, placebo or metformin 850 mg two times a day all ovulatory cycle for three trials maximum. Ovulation detection was done by the E2 serum measurements and ovarian transvaginal ultrasonography' evolution controlling on 7th, 11th and 13th day of the cycle. Within 7 months, 32 PCOS women were recruited in the study and equally allocated to the two groups. Baseline characteristics were similar in metformin group and placebo one. Ovulation was characterized by the presence of at least one mature follicle (> 16 mm), a circulating estradiol concentration in the edge of 150-250 pg and accessory an endometrial depth > 8 mm. The ovulation rate in the metformin group was 62.5% compared with 37.5% in the placebo group, a non-statistically significant (small study population) but important difference (1.66 times). Analyses show a higher mature follicle number and estradiol concentration in metformin group than in the placebo one. Metformin effect was, in our study, his only insulinosensitizer property consequence far away a 'making thinner' or Hyperandrogenism reducing ones. The ovulatory response to clomifene can be increased in polycystic ovary syndrome women by decreasing insulin secretion with metformin.",

In breast cancer (BC), IGF1R and estrogen receptor expression are correlated. In this current study we explored the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone receptor positive (HR+ve) BC patients with high IGF1R tumor expression still have estrogen driven IGF1R stimulated tumor growth when treated with tamoxifen, resulting in detrimental clinical outcome compared to patients treated with exemestane. Additionally, we assessed the added value of metformin as this drug may lower IGF1R stimulation. Of 2,446 Dutch TEAM patients, randomized to either exemestane for 5 years or sequential treatment (tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by exemestane for another 3-2 years) tumor tissue microarray sections were immunohistochemically stained for IGF1R. Overall Survival (OS), Breast Cancer specific Survival (BCSS) and Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) were assessed in patient subgroups with low and high IGF1R expression, and in patients with or without metformin use. High IGF1R tumor expression was significantly associated with exemestane therapy for RFS (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.58-0.95, p = 0.02). In addition, the combination of metformin with exemestane resulted in improved efficacy, yielding a 5-yrs RFS of 95% (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10-1.00, p = 0.02, compared to sequential treatment). No relation was observed in tumors with low IGF-1R expression. This study suggests IGF1R as a potential biomarker of improved clinical outcome in HR+ve BC patients treated with exemestane. Adding metformin to exemestane treatment may add to this effect.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. HCC burden has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years. Most HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options. Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied. Metformin may decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of combined treatment are still unclear. As HCC is characterized by high vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 α could offer information about HCC response to sorafenib. We conducted this study to assess the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of VEGF and HIF-1 α in HCC prognosis. This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF and HIF-1 α were evaluated. We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 49-68 years). Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%). Sixty percent of patients were diabetic. No significant difference was detected between arm A and arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression (p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6). Low VEGF and HIF-1 α plasma levels were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for both), and higher OS (p < 0.001). Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). No superior efficacy of adding metformin to sorafenib in HCC treatment. VEGF and HIF-1 α had promising prognostic value in HCC.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer patients treated with adriamycin-cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel (AC-T) are often challenged with serious adverse effects for which no effective therapies are available. Here, we investigated whether metformin, an antidiabetic drug with additional pleiotropic effects could favourably offset AC-T induced toxicities. Seventy non-diabetic breast cancer patients were randomised to receive either AC-T (adriamycin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 4 cycles Q21 days, followed by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 12 cycles) alone or AC-T plus metformin (1700 mg/day). Patients were assessed regularly after each cycle to record the incidence and severity of adverse events based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0. Moreover, baseline echocardiography and ultrasonography were done and repeated after the end of neoadjuvant therapy. Addition of metformin to AC-T resulted in significantly less incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy, oral mucositis, and fatigue (p < 0.05) compared to control arm. Moreover, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) in the control arm dropped from a mean of 66.69 ± 4.57 to 62.2 ± 5.22% (p = 0.0004) versus a preserved cardiac function in the metformin arm (64.87 ± 4.84 to 65.94 ± 3.44%, p = 0.2667). Furthermore, fatty liver incidence was significantly lower in metformin compared with control arm (8.33% vs 51.85%, p = 0.001). By contrast, haematological disturbances caused by AC-T were preserved after concurrent metformin administration (p > 0.05). Metformin offers a therapeutic opportunity for controlling toxicities caused by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-diabetic breast cancer patients. This randomised controlled trial was registered on November 20, 2019 in ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number: NCT04170465.",

The current study evaluates the anticancer activity of metformin in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced BC patients. Additionally, we assess the safety and tolerability of this combination and its effect on the quality of life (QoL) of BC patients. Eighty non-diabetic female patients with proven locally advanced BC were randomized into two arms. The first arm received anthracycline/taxane-based NACT plus metformin. The second arm received anthracycline/taxane-based NACT only. Overall response rate (ORR), clinical complete response (cCr), pathological complete response (pCR), and breast conservative rate (BCR) were evaluated between both groups, and correlated with serum metformin concentration. ORR, cCr, pCR, and BCR increased non-significantly in the metformin group compared to the control group; 80.6% vs 68.4%, 27.8% vs 10.5%, 22.2% vs 10.5%, and 19.4% vs 13.2%, respectively. A trend towards cCR and pCR was associated with higher serum metformin concentrations. Metformin decreased the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, bone pain, and arthralgia, although worsened the gastrointestinal adverse events. Metformin combination with NACT has no effect on the QoL of BC patients. Metformin combination with NACT is safe, tolerable, and improves non-significantly the clinical and pathological tumor response of BC patients.",

      "abstract": "In preclinical work and retrospective population studies, the anti-diabetic drug metformin has been associated with antineoplastic activity and decreased burden of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer. There is therefore interest in the hypothesis that this drug might be repurposed for indications in oncology. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the addition of metformin to a standard systemic therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, and provide the first report of a clinical trial with a survival endpoint of metformin for an oncological indication. We did this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at four centres in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (1:1), via a permutated computer-generated block allocation scheme (block size of six) to receive intravenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks and oral erlotinib (100mg) once daily in combination with either oral metformin or placebo twice daily. Metformin dose was escalated from 500 mg (in the first week) to 1000 mg twice daily in the second week. Randomisation was stratified by hospital, diabetes status, and tumour stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 6 months in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01210911. Between May 31, 2010, and Jan 3, 2014, we randomly assigned 121 patients to receive gemcitabine and erlotinib with either placebo (n=61) or metformin (n=60). Overall survival at 6 months was 63·9% (95% CI 51·9-75·9) in the placebo group and 56·7% (44·1-69·2) in the metformin group (p=0·41). There was no difference in overall survival between groups (median 7·6 months [95% CI 6·1-9·1] vs 6·8 months [95% CI 5·1-8·5] in the metformin group; hazard ratio [HR] 1·056 [95% CI 0·72-1·55]; log-rank p=0·78). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxic effects were neutropenia (15 [25%] patients in placebo group vs 15 [25%] in metformin group), skin rash (six [10%] vs four [7%]), diarrhoea (three [5%] vs six [10%]), and fatigue (two [3%] vs six [10%]). Addition of a conventional anti-diabetic dose of metformin does not improve outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine and erlotinib. Future research should include studies of more potent biguanides, and should focus on patients with hyperinsulinaemia and patients with tumours showing markers of sensitivity to energetic stress, such as loss of function of AMP kinase, a key regulator of cellular energy homoeostasis.

      "abstract": "The combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist and gonadotropin represents a valid alternative to the classical protocol with GnRH agonist for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The use of metformin is of benefit to women with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to compare the stimulation characteristics and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer (ET) outcomes of the standard short GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation with or without metformin. We recruited 40 PCOS patients. The population studied was divided into two groups (A and B). Group A was pretreated for 2 months with metformin 1.5 g/day (Glucophage(R); Merck Pharm), and then stimulated with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) 150 UI/day (Gonal F(R) 75 UI; Serono). GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix acetate 0.25 mg/day (Cetrotide(R); Serono), was started when the leading follicle reached 14 mm diameter on ultrasound scan. Group B was treated only with rFSH 150 UI/day and GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg/day when the leading follicle was >or=14 mm in diameter. In group A we found a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the number of ampoules of rFSH (A vs. B: 18+/-6 vs. 24+/-8) and estradiol levels (A vs. B: 2400+/-600 vs. 3370+/-900 pg/ml) (all values mean+/-standard deviation). Group A had significantly fewer cancelled cycles (A vs. B: 1 vs. 3; p < 0.05). The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was 5% in group A and 15% in group B (p < 0.05). In patients treated with metformin, the total number of follicles on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment (23+/-1.2 vs. 33+/-2.6) was decreased with no change in the number of follicles >or=14 mm in diameter (A vs. B: 18+/-1.2 vs. 19+/-1.7). However, the mean number of mature oocytes (A vs. B: 8.4+/-1.5 vs. 5.0+/-1.5) was increased with metformin treatment (p < 0.05). No difference was found in the number of cleaved embryos (A vs. B: 2.5+/-0.5 vs. 2.2+/-0.3). The use of metformin with GnRH antagonist improves the outcome of ovarian stimulation in IVF-ET cycles in PCOS patients.",

      "abstract": "Few prospective studies have compared the cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin for modulating cardiometabolic risk factors including high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, hypoglycemia, and body weight. This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group trial enrolled 340 Japanese patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes receiving metformin alone or no glucose-lowering agents, who were randomized to receive dapagliflozin or sitagliptin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), avoidance of hypoglycemia (maintenance of sensor glucose ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or ≥ 54 mg/dL), and ≥ 3.0% body weight loss from baseline. Secondary endpoints included components of the primary endpoint, other metabolic indices, and glucose variability indices measured using flash glucose monitoring. Clinical characteristics of patients were age, 58.1 ± 12.2 years; known duration of diabetes, 5.8 ± 6.1 years; body weight, 74.7 ± 14.2 kg; body mass index, 27.9 ± 4.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and HbA1c level, 7.8 ± 0.8% at baseline. The achievement ratio of primary endpoint was significantly higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the sitagliptin group (24.4% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.05). While the rates of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and avoidance of hypoglycemia were comparable between the groups (49.4 vs. 50.0% and 88.7 vs. 92.3% for dapagliflozin vs. sitagliptin, respectively), body weight loss of ≥ 3.0% was significantly achieved in the dapagliflozin group (54.4 vs. 19.6%, P < 0.001). Moreover, dapagliflozin was superior to sitagliptin regarding several secondary endpoints that modulate cardiometabolic risk, namely reducing fasting plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and suppressing the increase in serum creatinine and the decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, sitagliptin was superior to dapagliflozin in suppressing glucose variability. Compared to sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was significantly more effective at improving cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors might be more suitable than DPP-4 inhibitors for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with early-stage but inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common benign solid breast mass in women, with no definite method of management. Because fibroadenoma is dependent on female sex hormones and comprises hypertrophic changes at cellular levels, we investigated the effects of metformin (MF), a safe hypoglycemic agent with anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative properties, in the management of fibroadenoma. In this randomized clinical trial study, eligible women with fibroadenomas were assigned randomly to the metformin (1000 mg daily for six months) or the placebo group. Breast physical and ultrasound exam was performed before and after the intervention, and the changes in the size of fibroadenomas were compared in the two groups. Overall, 83 patients in the treatment, and 92 in the placebo group completed the study. A statistically significant difference in changing size between the two groups was observed only in the smallest mass. In the largest FAs, the rate of size reduction was higher in the treatment group (60.2 % vs. 43.5 %); while a higher rate of enlargement was observed in the placebo group (38 % vs. 20.5 %). In the smallest FAs, the rate of the masses that got smaller or remained stable was about 90 % in the treatment group and 50 % in the placebo group. We categorized size changes of FAs into < 20 % enlargement and ≥ 20 % enlargement. The odds ratio (OR) for an elargemnt less than 20% was 1.48 (95 % CI = 1.10-1.99) in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group; the odds for an enlargement less than 20% was higher in women with multiples fibroadenomas (OR = 4.67, 95 % CI: 1.34-16.28). In our study, no serious adverse effect was recorded, and the medicine was well-tolerated by all users. This is the first study that evaluates the effect of MF on the management of fibroadenoma, and the results suggest a favorable effect. Larger studies using higher doses of MF and including a separate design for patients with single or multiple FAs are suggested in order to confirm this effect. This trial (IRCT20100706004329N7) was retrospectively registered on 2018-10-07.",

Metformin, 1.5-2.55 g/day, throughout pregnancy. Rates of first-trimester spontaneous abortion and teratogenicity. Before metformin, 10 women had 22 previous pregnancies with 16 first-trimester spontaneous abortions (73%). While receiving metformin, these 10 women had 6 normal live births (60%), 1 spontaneous abortion (10%), and 3 normal ongoing pregnancies (30%) (all > or = 13 weeks; median gestation, 23 weeks). Among women receiving metformin, including those with live births and normal pregnancy for at least the first trimester, 1 of 10 (10%) had first-trimester spontaneous abortion compared with 73% in 22 previous pregnancies without metformin (P<.002). To date, the 19 women receiving metformin have had no adverse maternal side effects, and no birth defects have occurred; 9 (47%) had normal term live births, 2 (11%) had normal and appropriate for gestational age births (one at 33 and one at 35 weeks), 6 (32%) have ongoing normal pregnancies lasting longer than the first trimester, and 2 (10.5%) had first-trimester spontaneous abortions. Sonography showed normal fetal development without congenital defects in the 6 ongoing pregnancies (median gestation, 23 weeks). Among women who received metformin before conception, reductions in insulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity were correlated (r=0.65, P=.04). Metformin therapy throughout pregnancy in women with PCOS reduces the otherwise high rate of first-trimester spontaneous abortion seen among women not receiving metformin and does not appear to be teratogenic.",

Metformin-induced inhibition of cancer cell proliferation has been confirmed in vitro but not in humans. Because endometrial cancer is associated with insulin resistance, the authors investigated whether a diabetes-therapeutic metformin dose inhibits cancer cell growth in patients with endometrial cancer. A dose of metaformin was administered (1500-2250 mg/day) to 31 patients with endometrial cancer preoperatively for 4 to 6 weeks. Cell proliferation was assessed in patient tissues using immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses and DNA synthesis was measured in serum using a thymidine uptake assay. All statistical tests were 2-sided. P values of < .05 were considered statistically significant. Preoperative metformin treatment decreased DNA synthesis in sera and significantly reduced the Ki-67 (mean proportional decrease, 44.2%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 35.4-53.0 [P < .001]) and topoisomerase IIα (mean proportional decrease, 36.4%; 95% CI, 26.7-46.0 [P < .001]) labeling indices. Levels of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were found to be significantly decreased and phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and p27 levels were significantly increased. Preoperative metformin use caused significant decreases in circulating factors, including insulin, glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1, and leptin. DNA synthesis-stimulating activity in patient sera was significantly decreased during metformin administration. An antidiabetic dose of metformin inhibited endometrial cancer cell growth in vivo, an effect likely due to its effect on humoral factor(s). This translational study provides considerable rationale to initiate large clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease characterized by the development of numerous colorectal adenomas in young adults. Metformin, an oral diabetic drug, has been shown to have antineoplastic effects and a favorable safety profile. We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of metformin on the regression of colorectal and duodenal adenoma in patients with FAP. Thirty-four FAP patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive placebo, 500 mg metformin, or 1,500 mg metformin per day orally for 7 months. The number and size of polyps and the global polyp burden were evaluated before and after the intervention. This study was terminated early based on the results of the interim analysis. No significant differences were determined in the percentage change of colorectal and duodenal polyp number over the course of treatment among the three treatment arms (<i>P</i> = 0.627 and <i>P</i> = 1.000, respectively). We found no significant differences in the percentage change of colorectal or duodenal polyp size among the three groups (<i>P</i> = 0.214 and <i>P</i> = 0.803, respectively). The overall polyp burdens of the colorectum and duodenum were not significantly changed by metformin treatment at either dosage. Colon polyps removed from the metformin-treated patients showed significantly lower mTOR signal (p-S6) expression than those from patients in the placebo arm. In conclusion, 7 months of treatment with 500 mg or 1,500 mg metformin did not reduce the mean number or size of polyps in the colorectum or duodenum in FAP patients (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01725490). PREVENTION RELEVANCE: A 7-month metformin treatment (500 mg or 1,500 mg) did not reduce the number or size of polyps in the colorectum or duodenum of FAP patients as compared to placebo. These results do not support the use of metformin to promote regression of intestinal adenomas in FAP patients.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that metformin may reduce the incidence of cancer in patients with diabetes and multiple late phase clinical trials assessing the potential of repurposing this drug are underway. Transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples is an excellent tool to understand drug bioactivity, identify candidate biomarkers and assess for mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Thirty-six patients with untreated primary breast cancer were recruited to a window study and transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples carried out before and after metformin treatment. Multiple genes that regulate fatty acid oxidation were upregulated at the transcriptomic level and there was a differential change in expression between two previously identified cohorts of patients with distinct metabolic responses. Increase in expression of a mitochondrial fatty oxidation gene composite signature correlated with change in a proliferation gene signature. In vitro assays showed that, in contrast to previous studies in models of normal cells, metformin reduces fatty acid oxidation with a subsequent accumulation of intracellular triglyceride, independent of AMPK activation. We propose that metformin at clinical doses targets fatty acid oxidation in cancer cells with implications for patient selection and drug combinations. NCT01266486.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with an incidence of 5% in women of reproductive age, is defined as the presence of oligo- or amenorrhea in combination with hyperandrogenism. Most patients also suffer from impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). PCOS thus resembles the metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, lipid disorders, atherosclerosis). International studies showed a beneficial effect of metformin treatment on biochemical and reproductive parameters in PCOS. The aim of our study is the evaluation of metformin treatment in a German PCOS sample. 103 PCOS women (age 18-40) were treated, according to their body weight, with either 1000 mg or 1700 mg metformin per day after assessment of insulin resistance. Clinical features as well as endocrine and metabolic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months of treatment. Additionally, baseline data were compared with those of 98 control subjects (age 18-38). PCOS women showed significantly higher body mass index, body fat mass and androgen levels, as well as an impaired glucose- and insulin metabolism compared to controls. Metformin treatment ameliorated acne (36% to 4%), hirsutism-score (11.2 to 9.7) and restarted normal menstrual cycles in 66.7% of PCOS-women. Sixteen of 48 patients with unfulfilled wish to conceive became pregnant during therapy. Metformin restored menses in all previously amenorrheic women. Comparing post-metformin versus baseline levels, HOMA-IR (4.6 to 2.3), AUC-I (379 to 225) and 2-h glucose (117 to 90 mg/dl) decreased significantly. Furthermore, metformin decreased testosterone (2.9 to 1.8 nmol/l), free androgen index (9.1 to 5.3) and dehydroepiandrosterone levels (5.1 to 3.9 mg/l). Metformin improves significantly hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in PCOS patients and appears to be an efficacious mode of therapy.",

Here, we analyzed GDF15 levels in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who participated in OCOG-ALMERA (NCT02115464), a phase II randomized clinical trial, that investigated metformin in combination with standard of care concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). OCOG-ALMERA was not able to demonstrate benefit in the metformin arm. Therefore, biomarker studies are needed to better define stratification parameters for future trials. Patients were randomized to treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent chest radiotherapy (60-66 Gy), with or without metformin (2000 mg/d). The trial collected tumor volume parameters, survival outcomes, and patient blood plasma at baseline, during (weeks 1 and 6) and 6 months after cCRT. Plasma GDF15 levels were assayed with the ELISA method. Statistical analyses explored associations between GDF15, survival outcomes, and radiotherapy tumor volumes. Baseline plasma levels of GDF15 were elevated in study patients, they increased during cCRT (p < 0.001), and the addition of metformin was associated with a further increase (week 6, p = 0.033). Baseline GDF15 levels correlated with the radiotherapy gross target volume (GTV, p < 0.01), while week 1 of radiotherapy levels correlated with radiotherapy planned target volume (PTV, p < 0.006). In multivariate analysis, baseline plasma GDF15 was prognostic for poor relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively). GDF15 is a plasma marker that responds to the treatment of unresected LA-NSCLC with cCRT and metformin. GDF15 levels correspond with tumor volume and increased GDF15 levels predict for poor RFS and OS. These results require validation in larger clinical trial datasets.",

Trilaciclib is a substrate and time-dependent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and an inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1, multidrug and toxin extrusion 2-K, organic cation transporter 1, and organic cation transporter 2. Here, we investigate the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction potential of trilaciclib. Two phase I studies were conducted as prospective, open-label, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects (n = 57, n = 20) to investigate potential interactions between intravenously administered trilaciclib (200 or 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and orally administered midazolam (5 mg), metformin (1000 mg), itraconazole (200 mg), and rifampin (600 mg). A population pharmacokinetic model was fit to phase Ib/IIa data in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (n = 114) to assess the impact of trilaciclib dose and exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) on topotecan clearance. Coadministration with trilaciclib had minimal effects on the exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) of midazolam (geometric least-square mean ratio [GMR] vs midazolam alone 1.065; 90% confidence interval [CI] 0.984-1.154) but statistically significantly increased plasma exposure (GMR 1.654; 90% CI 1.472-1.858) and decreased renal clearance (GMR 0.633; 90% CI 0.572-0.701) of metformin. Coadministration of trilaciclib with rifampin or itraconazole decreased trilaciclib area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity by 17.3% (GMR 0.827; 90% CI 0.785-0.871) and 14.0% (GMR 0.860; 0.820-0.902), respectively, vs trilaciclib alone. Population pharmacokinetic modeling showed no significant effect of trilaciclib on topotecan clearance. Overall, the drug-drug interaction and safety profiles of trilaciclib in these studies support its continued use in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.

In addition, selective inhibition of PDE4 enzyme has recently been implicated in the regulation of metabolism with positive effects on glucose homeostasis and weight reduction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast affects body weight and hormonal and metabolic status in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design/Participants/Main Outcome Measures: A 12-week prospective randomized open-label study was conducted with 36 obese women with PCOS diagnosed by the National Eunice Kennedy Shriver Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria that had been pretreated with metformin (MET). They were randomized to MET 1000 mg twice a day or combined treatment (COM) with MET 1000 mg twice a day and roflumilast 500 μg every day. The primary outcome was change in anthropometric measures of obesity. Thirty-one patients (aged 33.8 ± 7.4 y, twice a day 36.4 ± 5.1 kg/m(2), mean ± SD) completed the study: 16 on MET and 15 on COM. Subjects treated with COM lost on average 4.2 ± 2.8 kg compared with a 0.9 ± 2.5 kg weight gain in the MET group (P = .025). Body mass index decreased for 1.6 ± 1.1 kg/m(2) in COM arm compared with increase for 0.9 ± 2.4 kg/m(2) in the MET arm (P = .046). Visceral adipose tissue area as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry decreased from 136.7 ± 37.8 to 121.2 ± 36.2 cm(2) in the COM arm compared with an increase from 155.3 ± 61.9 to 166.7 ± 67.2 cm(2) in the MET arm (P = .02). From baseline to study end, both treatment interventions resulted in a significant reduction of androstenedione (P = .013), free T (P = .002), and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance score (P = .027) and a significant increase in SHBG (P = .024), although the between-treatment differences of the changes have not been statistically significant yet. Roflumilast added to metformin reduced body weight in obese women with PCOS, primarily due to a loss of fat mass.",

There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. Metformin combined with intensive-exercise diet therapy significantly improves the glucose and lipid metabolism and islet function of renal cancer patients with diabetes and effectively enhances the 12-month progression-free survival. Further trials are, however, required prior to clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Background Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are microbially derived end products of dietary fiber fermentation. The SCFA butyrate reduces blood pressure (BP) in mouse models. The association of SCFAs, including butyrate, with BP in humans is unclear, due in part to predominantly cross-sectional analyses and different biospecimens (blood versus fecal) for SCFA measurement. Longitudinal studies including both circulating and fecal SCFAs are lacking. Methods and Results We leveraged existing data from the SPIRIT (Survivorship Promotion In Reducing IGF-1 Trial), which randomized 121 adult cancer survivors with overweight/obesity to a behavioral weight-loss intervention, metformin, or self-directed weight-loss. Of participants with baseline serum and fecal SCFAs measured (n=111), a subset had serum (n=93) and fecal (n=89) SCFA measurements 12 months later. We used Poisson regression with robust error variance to estimate baseline associations of SCFAs with hypertension, and we assessed the percent change in SCFAs from baseline with corresponding 12-month changes in BP using multiple linear regression. Baseline fecal butyrate was inversely associated with prevalent hypertension (standardized PR [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.54, 0.92]). A 10% increase in fecal butyrate from baseline was associated with decreased systolic BP (β [95%CI]: -0.56 [-1.01, -0.10] mm Hg), and a 10% increase in serum butyrate was associated with decreased systolic (β [95%CI]: -1.39 [-2.15, -0.63] mm Hg) and diastolic (β [95%CI]: -0.55 [-1.03, -0.08] mm Hg) BPs. Butyrate associations with systolic BP were linear and not modified by sex, race, or intervention arm. Conclusions Increased serum or fecal butyrate is associated with lowered BP. Butyrate may be a target for SCFA-centered BP-lowering interventions. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02431676.",

In the general population, obesity and diabetes are risk factors for cognitive decline, and weight loss can improve cognition; however, the impact of intentional weight loss on cancer survivors' cognition has not been tested. We investigated the impact of weight loss and metformin on changes in cognitive function in a sample of breast cancer survivors. Overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 333) were randomized to a weight loss intervention versus control and metformin versus placebo in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Outcomes were changes in five cognitive domains from baseline to 6 months measured by objective neurocognitive tests. There were no statistically significant intervention effects for the metformin or weight loss interventions in five neurocognitive domains. Baseline body mass index (BMI) was a significant effect modifier of the changes in verbal functioning for the weight loss (P = 0.009) and metformin interventions (P = 0.0125). These effect modifications were independent of percent weight loss achieved during the 6-month study period. This randomized controlled trial of weight loss and metformin interventions that examined changes to cognition among breast cancer survivors suggests that these interventions may not improve cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors in general. However, weight loss may improve verbal functioning among individuals with a higher BMI.",

      "abstract": "Metformin may reduce the incidence of breast cancer and enhance response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in diabetic women. This trial examined the effects of metformin on Ki67 and gene expression in primary breast cancer. Non-diabetic women with operable invasive breast cancer received pre-operative metformin. A pilot cohort of eight patients had core biopsy of the cancer at presentation, a week later (without treatment; internal control), then following metformin 500-mg o.d. for 1 week increased to 1-g b.d. for a further week continued to surgery. A further 47 patients had core biopsy at diagnosis were randomized to metformin (the same dose regimen) or no drug, and 2 weeks later had core biopsy at surgery. Ki67 immunohistochemistry, transcriptome analysis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores and serum insulin determination were performed blinded to treatment. Seven patients (7/32, 21.9%) receiving metformin withdrew because of gastrointestinal upset. The mean percentage of cells staining for Ki67 fell significantly following metformin treatment in both the pilot cohort (P = 0.041, paired t-test) and in the metformin arm (P = 0.027, Wilcoxon rank test) but was unchanged in the internal control or metformin control arms. Messenger RNA expression was significantly downregulated by metformin for PDE3B (phosphodiesterase 3B, cGMP-inhibited; a critical regulator of cAMP levels that affect activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK), confirmed by immunohistochemistry, SSR3, TP53 and CCDC14. By ingenuity pathway analysis, the tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway was most affected by metformin: TGFB and MEKK were upregulated and cdc42 downregulated; mTOR and AMPK pathways were also affected. Gene set analysis additionally revealed that p53, BRCA1 and cell cycle pathways also had reduced expression following metformin. Mean serum insulin remained stable in patients receiving metformin but rose in control patients. This trial presents biomarker evidence for anti-proliferative effects of metformin in women with breast cancer and provides support for therapeutic trials of metformin.",

Prospective randomized controlled trail. Tertiary teaching hospital. Obese Chinese women (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with insulin resistance who fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria of PCOS. In group 1, 68 patients administered metformin (1,500 mg/day); in group 2, 67 patients administered rosiglitazone (4 mg/day); in group 3, 69 patients administered metformin (1,000 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 6 months, all with the same diet and regular exercise lifestyle recommendation. Average menstrual interval, anthropometric measurements, androgen-related parameters, and metabolic features of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids, with intention-to-treat analysis. The baseline parameters showed no statistically significant differences. After the 6-month treatment, most participants showed an improved menstrual pattern. There were statistically significant decreases in acne scores, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum testosterone. The metabolic indexes of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids were improved obviously compared with the baseline in each group. Among the three groups, the patients administered 1,500 mg/day metformin experienced greater reductions in weight. However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone alone or combined with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for the women with abnormal lipid profiles.

Knowledge is lacking about the complex interaction between thyroid status and PCOS during pregnancy. We investigated the thyroid status and its association with pregnancy complications in PCOS, and in relation to metformin treatment. <i>Post-hoc</i> analyses of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. 288 pregnant women with PCOS were randomized to treatment with metformin or placebo from first trimester to delivery. We measured serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) at gestational week (gw) 5-12, 19, 32 and 36 and related to metformin treatment and pregnancy complications. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) were analyzed at inclusion and at gw 36. The overall prevalence of subclinical and overt hypothyroidism was 1.5% and 0%, respectively. The TSH level was not affected by metformin, whereas fT4 was significantly higher in the metformin group with less decrease throughout pregnancy compared to placebo, p<0.001. A lower decrease in fT4 during pregnancy correlated to less weight gain (r= -0.17, p=0.020) and tended to be associated with reduced odds ratio for gestational diabetes (OR 0.85 per 1 pmol/L, 95% CI 0.71;1.02). In women with PCOS, metformin treatment during pregnancy was associated with less decrease in fT4 compared to placebo, while it did not affect TSH. A smaller decrease in fT4 correlated to less weight gain and tended to be associated with a lower risk of gestational diabetes.

The NCIC Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) MA.32 investigates effects of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease-free survival and other outcomes in early breast cancer. Maintaining blinding of investigators to outcomes, we conducted a planned, Data Safety Monitoring Committee-approved, analysis of the effect of metformin vs placebo on weight and metabolic factors at six months, including examination of interactions with baseline body mass index (BMI) and insulin, in the first 492 patients with paired blood samples. Eligible nondiabetic subjects with T1-3, N0-3, M0 breast cancer who had completed surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (if given) provided fasting plasma samples at random assignment and at six months. Glucose was measured locally; blood was aliquoted, frozen, and stored at -80°C. Paired plasma aliquots were analyzed for insulin, hs-CRP, and leptin. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and comparisons analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Mean age was 52.1±9.5 years in the metformin group and 52.6 ± 9.8 years in the placebo group. Arms were balanced for estrogen/progesterone receptor, BMI, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and stage. At six months, decreases in weight and blood variables were statistically significantly greater in the metformin arm (vs placebo) in univariate analyses: weight -3.0%, glucose -3.8%, insulin -11.1%, homeostasis model assessment -17.1%, leptin -20.2%, hs-CRP -6.7%; all P values were less than or equal to .03. There was no statistically significant interaction of change in these variables with baseline BMI or insulin. Metformin statistically significantly improved weight, insulin, glucose, leptin, and CRP at six months. Effects did not vary by baseline BMI or fasting insulin.",

      "abstract": "Two-thirds of U.S. adult women are overweight or obese. High body mass index (BMI) and adult weight gain are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. The higher postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with elevated BMI is likely to be attributable to related metabolic disturbances including altered circulating sex steroid hormones and adipokines, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and insulin resistance. Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic drug that has demonstrated favorable effects on metabolic disturbances and as such may lead to lower breast cancer risk in obese women. Further, the anti-proliferative effects of metformin suggest it may decrease breast density, an accepted biomarker of breast cancer risk. This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin in overweight/obese premenopausal women who have elements of metabolic syndrome. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive metformin 850 mg BID (n = 75) or placebo (n = 75) for 12 months. The primary endpoint is change in breast density, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired fat-water features. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum insulin levels, serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 to insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 ratio, serum IGF-2 levels, serum testosterone levels, serum leptin to adiponectin ratio, body weight, and waist circumference. Exploratory outcomes include changes in metabolomic profiles in plasma and nipple aspirate fluid. Changes in tissue architecture as well as cellular and molecular targets in breast tissue collected in a subgroup of participants will also be explored. The study will evaluate whether metformin can result in favorable changes in breast density, select proteins and hormones, products of body metabolism, and body weight and composition. The study should help determine the potential breast cancer preventive activity of metformin in a growing population at risk for multiple diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02028221 .

      "abstract": "The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate remains at 50% for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC), thereby underscoring the need for improved treatments. An antidiabetic agent, metformin, was found in retrospective studies to improve survival in patients with HNSCC. Therefore, the authors conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study combining metformin with chemoradiotherapy in patients with LAHNSCC. Nondiabetic patients with LAHNSCC were enrolled in the current study to receive escalating doses of metformin and CRT based on the modified toxicity probability interval design. Metformin cohort doses included 2000 mg, 2550 mg, and 3000 mg daily in divided doses in addition to cisplatin (at a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 22, and 43) and standard radiotherapy (70 grays). Adverse events were categorized as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Twenty patients were enrolled, 2 of whom withdrew consent. The median age of the patients was 56 years and the majority were male (83%), were white (88%), had p16-positive disease (72%), and were tobacco users (61%). The median length of metformin exposure was 28.5 days. The most common grade ≥3 toxicities were nausea (11%), vomiting (11%), mucositis (6%), acute kidney injury (17%), anemia (6%), and leukopenia (11%). Dose-limiting toxicities included diarrhea and acute kidney injury. After a median follow-up of 19 months, the 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 90% and 84%, respectively. No hypoglycemia events or lactic acidosis were observed. Cisplatin administration did not appear to affect metformin pharmacokinetics. The maximum tolerated dose for metformin could not be determined given the limited number of patients who tolerated metformin during chemoradiotherapy. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first phase 1 trial combining metformin with chemoradiotherapy. Rates of overall survival and progression-free survival were encouraging in this limited patient population, and warrant further investigation in a phase 2 trial.",

      "abstract": "Metformin (MET) is increasingly implicated in reducing the incidence of multiple cancer types in patients with diabetes. However, similar effects of MET in non-diabetic women with endometrial cancer (EC) remain unknown. In a pilot study, obese non-diabetic women diagnosed with type 1, grade 1/2 EC, and consenting to participate were randomly assigned to receive MET or no MET (control (CON)) during the pre-surgical window between diagnosis and hysterectomy. Endometrial tumors obtained at surgery (MET, n = 4; CON, n = 4) were analyzed for proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and nuclear expression of ERα, PGR, PTEN, and KLF9 proteins in tumor glandular epithelial (GE) and stromal (ST) cells. The percentages of immunopositive cells for PGR and for KLF9 in GE and for PTEN in ST were higher while those for ERα in GE but not ST were lower, in tumors of MET vs. CON patients. The numbers of Ki67- and TUNEL-positive cells in tumor GE and ST did not differ between groups. In human Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, MET treatment (60 μM) decreased cell numbers and elicited distinct temporal changes in ESR1, KLF9, PGR, PGR-B, KLF4, DKK1, and other tumor biomarker mRNA levels. In the context of reduced KLF9 expression (by siRNA targeting), MET rapidly amplified PGR, PGR-B, and KLF4 transcript levels. Our findings suggest that MET acts directly in EC cells to modify steroid receptor expression and signaling network and may constitute a preventative strategy against EC in high-risk non-diabetic women.",
