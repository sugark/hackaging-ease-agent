      "abstract": "Preclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC. We retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin's impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin's effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin's effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models. Metformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024). Metformin may improve lung cancer-specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin's anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Metformin and aspirin are commonly co-prescribed to people with diabetes. Metformin may prevent cancer, but in older people (over 70 years), aspirin has been found to increase cancer mortality. This study examined whether metformin reduces cancer mortality and incidence in older people with diabetes; it used randomization to 100 mg aspirin or placebo in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to quantify aspirin's impact on metformin users. Analysis included community-dwelling ASPREE participants (aged ≥70 years, or ≥65 years for members of US minority populations) with diabetes. Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level greater than 125 mg/dL, self-report of diabetes, or antidiabetic medication use. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the association of metformin and a metformin-aspirin interaction with cancer incidence and mortality, with adjustment for confounders. Of 2045 participants with diabetes at enrollment, 965 were concurrently using metformin. Metformin was associated with a reduced cancer incidence risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51 to 0.90), but no conclusive benefit for cancer mortality (adjusted HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.43 to 1.19). Metformin users randomized to aspirin had greater risk of cancer mortality compared with placebo (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.18 to 5.43), but no effect was seen for cancer incidence (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.64). The possible effect modification of aspirin on cancer mortality, however, was not statistically significant (interaction P = .11). In community-dwelling older adults with diabetes, metformin use was associated with reduced cancer incidence. Increased cancer mortality risk in metformin users randomized to aspirin warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01038583.",

      "abstract": "There is literature that suggests metformin may play a protective role against the development of non-melanoma skin cancers. Given the significant burden of disease non-melanoma skin cancers represent, the possibility of a widely available and generally well-tolerated medication such as metformin as part of the prevention and treatment ladder warrants further research. This study aims to evaluate the potential of metformin in reducing the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, specifically squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, using the All of Us research database. A retrospective case-control analysis was conducted using the All of Us database. Propensity score matching and multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of metformin on the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) while controlling for confounding variables. Our results indicate a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancer following exposure to metformin in individuals diagnosed with both SCC and BCC. Subgroup analyses revealed that metformin exposure was associated with a decreased risk of BCC across all sex and ethnicity groups. Metformin use was also associated with a significantly lower risk of SCC, with univariable and multivariable ORs consistently showing reduced odds. However, metformin exposure was not significantly associated with decreased SCC risk in African American patients. Our study's findings indicate a potential protective effect of metformin against skin cancer, particularly in patients with skin of color. Further prospective research is necessary to substantiate metformin's role in skin cancer chemoprevention within these populations.J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(12):1089-1095. doi:10.36849/JDD.8249.",

We also wanted to examine if such an association, if exists, is influenced by metformin use. Stage I/II CRC adenocarcinoma patients treated surgically were identified. L3 level CT VFI (visceral fat index) was used as a metric of visceral obesity and was calculated as the proportion of total fat area composed of visceral fat. N = 492. 53% were males, 90% were Caucasians, 35% had stage I disease, and 14% used metformin. 20.3% patients developed a recurrence over a median follow-up of 56 months. VFI was associated with both RFS and OS in a multivariate model, but not BMI. The final multivariate model for RFS included an interaction term for VFI and metformin (p = 0.04). Confirming this result, subgroup analysis showed an increasing VFI was associated with a poor RFS (p = 0.002), and OS (p < 0.001) in metformin non-users only and metformin use was associated with a better RFS only in the top VFI tertile (p = 0.01). Visceral obesity, but not BMI, is associated with recurrence risk and poorer survival in stage I/II CRC. Interestingly, this association is influenced by metformin use.",

Tumor hypoxia has prognostic impact and represents a valid, interventional target. This phase II study investigated efficacy of the antidiabetic drug metformin to modify hypoxia according to established biomarkers. Preliminary results including tolerability, safety and feasibility are reported here. Patients were included in a 1:1 randomized, open-label design, comparing standard chemoradiotherapy ± metformin. Metformin 850 mg twice daily was administered 1 week before and during chemoradiotherapy. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline, after 1 week of metformin treatment, and at brachytherapy for biomarker assessments. Tolerability and safety were determined by treatment completion rates and frequency of adverse events (AEs). Safety was further evaluated by possible increase in MRI-based hypoxia during the first week of metformin. Feasibility was determined by proportion of completed study interventions and imaging and biopsy procedures. In total, 18 and 23 patients were allocated to the intervention and control arm, respectively. Eighteen and 15 patients completed metformin treatment for 1 and 5 weeks. Frequency of AEs ≥ grade 3 was not significantly different between study arms. Most AEs were gastrointestinal toxicities. Tumors with increase in hypoxia during the first week were all below the defined safety limit. A total of 98% of scheduled MR series and biopsies were collected with satisfactory quality. Addition of metformin to chemoradiotherapy is tolerable and safe. Serial sampling of MRI and tumor biopsies for hypoxia biomarker assessment is feasible.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United Kingdom has increased 60% in the past 10 years. The epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes are contributing factors. In this article, we examine the impact of diabetes and glucose-lowering treatments on HCC incidence and overall survival (OS). Data from 1064 patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease (CLD) (n = 340) or HCC (n = 724) were collected from 2007 to 2012. Patients with HCC were followed up prospectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression determined HCC risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine survival and Cox proportional hazards analysis estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to use of glucose-lowering therapies. Diabetes prevalence was 39.6% and 10.6% within the HCC and CLD cohorts, respectively. The odds ratio for having HCC in patients with diabetes was 5.55 (P < 0.001). Univariate analysis found an increased association of HCC with age, sex, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and Child's Pugh score. In multivariate analysis age, sex, cirrhosis, Child's Pugh score, diabetes status, and insulin use retained significance. Diabetes status did not significantly affect OS in HCC; however, in people with diabetes and HCC, metformin treatment was associated with improved OS (mean survival, 31 vs 24 months; P =0.016; HR for death = 0.75; P = 0.032). Diabetes is significantly associated with HCC in the United Kingdom. Metformin treatment is associated with improved OS after HCC diagnosis. Treatment of diabetes should be appropriately reviewed in high-risk populations, with specific consideration of the potential hepatoprotective effects of metformin in HCC.",

This study aimed to investigate the influence of metformin on patient survival and its potential correlation with distinct immune profiles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. We included 82 upfront resected and 66 gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT)-treated patients from the PREOPANC randomized controlled trial (RCT). Transcriptomic NanoString immunoprofiling was performed for a subset of 96 available resected specimens. Disparities in survival outcomes and immune profiles were apparent between metformin and non-metformin users in upfront resected patients but lacking in nCRT-treated patients. Compared to non-metformin users, upfront resected metformin users showed a higher median overall survival (OS) of 29 vs 14 months and a better 5-year OS rate of 19% vs 5%. Furthermore, metformin use was a favorable prognostic factor for OS in the upfront surgery group (HR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.99). Transcriptomic data revealed that metformin users significantly underexpressed genes related to pro-tumoral immunity, including monocyte to M2 macrophage polarization and activation. Furthermore, the relative abundance of anti-inflammatory CD163+ MRC1+ M2 macrophages in non-metformin users and immune-activating CD1A+ CD1C+ dendritic cells in metformin users was heightened (P < .001). This study unveils immune profile changes resulting from metformin use in upfront resected pancreatic cancer patients, possibly contributing to prolonged survival outcomes. Specifically, metformin use may decrease the abundance and activity of pro-tumoral M2 macrophages and increase the recruitment and function of tumor-resolving DCs, favoring antitumor immunity.[PREOPANC trial EudraCT: 2012-003181-40].",

      "abstract": "Immortal time bias (ITB) continues to distort many observational studies on metformin use and cancer risk. Our objective was to employ three statistical methods proven to avoid ITB and compare their results to that of a naïve time-fixed analysis in order to provide further evidence of metformin's association, or none thereof, with colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. A total of 41,533 Korean subjects with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes in 2005-2015 were selected from a prospectively maintained cohort (median follow-up of 6.3 years). Time-to-CRC incidence was regressed upon metformin use (yes/no, average prescription days/year) using time-dependent Cox, landmark, nested case-control, and time-fixed Cox analyses. Other CRC risk factors were included to adjust for possible confounding. Neither metformin ever-use nor average metformin prescription days/year was associated with incident CRC hazard in time-dependent Cox, landmark, and nested case-control analyses with HR (95% CI) of 0.88 (0.68-1.13), 0.86 (0.65-1.12), and 1.10 (0.86-1.40) for metformin ever-use, and 0.97 (0.90-1.04), 0.95 (0.88-1.04), and 1.02 (0.95-1.10) for average metformin prescription days/year, respectively. In contrast, time-fixed Cox regression showed a falsely exaggerated protective effect of metformin on CRC incidence. The association between metformin use and subsequent CRC incidence was statistically nonsignificant after accounting for time-related biases such as ITB. Previous studies that avoided these biases and meta-analyses of RCTs on metformin and cancer incidence were in agreement with our results. A definitive, large-scale RCT is needed to clarify this topic, and future observational studies should be explicit in avoiding ITB and other time-related biases.",

Patients with colorectal cancer and T2DM during 2000-2012 period were identified form Lithuanian Cancer Registry and the National Health Insurance Fund database. Colorectal cancer-specific survival (CS) was the primary outcome. It was measured from date of colorectal cancer diagnosis to date of death due to colorectal cancer, or last known date alive. 15,052 people who met eligibility criteria for this analysis, including 1094 (7.27%) with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (271 metformin never users and 823 metformin users) and 13 958 people without diabetes assessed. During follow-up (mean follow-up time was 4.4 years, with range from 1 day to 17 years) there were 10,927 deaths including 8559 from colorectal cancer. Significantly lower risk in CS between diabetic and non-diabetic people with lower risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.94) in diabetic patient population was seen. After adjustment for age, stage at diagnosis and metformin usage, significant difference in colorectal CS between metformin users in diabetic patient population compared to non-diabetics and metformin non-users in diabetic patient population was found (0.80 (0.72-0.89) vs 1.00 and vs 1.05 (0.91-1.23)). Overall survival (OS) was better for diabetic patients with significant difference in diabetic metformin users (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-0.94). Colorectal cancer patients with T2DM treated with metformin as part of their diabetic therapy appear to have a superior OS and CS. However, prospective controlled studies are still needed to evaluate the efficacy of metformin as an anti-tumor agent.",

      "abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to determine if metformin, an oral biguanide administered with first-line chemotherapy and continued as maintenance therapy, improves progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Patients with pathologically confirmed advanced-stage ovarian cancer undergoing primary debulking or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery were eligible to participate. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy with metformin 850 mg orally twice per day or placebo, followed by maintenance therapy (metformin or placebo) for two years from the date of randomization. 108 evaluable patients were enrolled; 54 were randomly assigned to metformin, and 54 to placebo. Sixty-six percent (n = 71) received neoadjuvant therapy, 31 % (n = 33) primary debulking surgery, and 88 % (n = 93) had tumors of high-grade serous histology. The primary endpoint, PFS, was not significantly different between the treatment groups (1-sided p-value = 0.31; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-1.36). Median PFS was 15.4 months (95 % CI: 11.2-23,5) for metformin and 14.3 months (95 % CI: 11.6-18.0) for placebo. Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different (2-sided p-value = 0.21; adjusted HR = 1.49, 95 % CI: 0.86-2.59), with a median of 40.7 months (95 % CI: 28.0-48.2) for metformin versus 43.8 months (95 % CI: 35.3-57.2) for placebo. The addition of metformin was well tolerated, and there were no differences in toxicity between the two groups. Although it was well-tolerated, adding metformin to first-line platinum/taxane-based therapy does not improve PFS or OS for patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "Several observational studies suggest that metformin reduces incidence cancer risk; however, many of these studies suffer from time-related biases and several cancer outcomes have not been investigated due to small sample sizes. We constructed a propensity score-matched retrospective cohort of 84,434 veterans newly prescribed metformin or a sulfonylurea as monotherapy. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to assess the association between metformin use compared to sulfonylurea use and incidence cancer risk for 10 solid tumors. We adjusted for clinical covariates including hemoglobin A1C, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, and body mass index. Incidence cancers were defined by ICD-9-CM codes. Among 42,217 new metformin users and 42,217 matched-new sulfonylurea users, we identified 2,575 incidence cancers. Metformin was inversely associated with liver cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.44, 95% CI 0.31, 0.64) compared to sulfonylurea. We found no association between metformin use and risk of incidence bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, prostate, or renal cancer when compared to sulfonylurea use. In this large cohort study that accounted for time-related biases, we observed no association between the use of metformin and most cancers; however, we found a strong inverse association between metformin and liver cancer. Randomized trials of metformin for prevention of liver cancer would be useful to verify these observations.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that metformin may reduce breast cancer incidence, but reports are mixed and few provide information on tumor characteristics. Therefore, we assessed associations among diabetes, metformin use, and breast cancer in postmenopausal women participating in Women's Health Initiative clinical trials. In all, 68,019 postmenopausal women, including 3,401 with diabetes at study entry, were observed over a mean of 11.8 years with 3,273 invasive breast cancers diagnosed. Diabetes incidence status was collected throughout follow-up, with medication information collected at baseline and years 1, 3, 6, and 9. Breast cancers were confirmed by review of central medical records and pathology reports. Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for breast cancer risk factors, compared breast cancer incidence in women with diabetes who were metformin users or nonusers with breast cancer incidence in women without diabetes. Compared with that in women without diabetes, breast cancer incidence in women with diabetes differed by diabetes medication type (P = .04). Women with diabetes receiving medications other than metformin had a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.45), and women with diabetes who were given metformin had lower breast cancer incidence (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99). The association was observed for cancers positive for both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and those that were negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Metformin use in postmenopausal women with diabetes was associated with lower incidence of invasive breast cancer. These results can inform future studies evaluating metformin use in breast cancer management and prevention.",

To avoid these biases, we examined the incidence of bladder cancer in new users of metformin and sulfonylureas (SUs). This cohort study included 87,600 patients with type 2 diabetes in The Health Improvement Network database. Use of metformin or an SU was treated as a time-dependent variable. Cox regression-generated hazard ratios (HRs) compared metformin use with SU use, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, obesity, and HbA1c level. We identified 196 incident bladder cancers in the metformin cohort and 66 cancers in the SU cohort. Use of metformin was not associated with decreased bladder cancer risk (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.60-1.09]). This association did not differ by sex (P for interaction = 0.20). We observed no association with duration of metformin relative to SU use (3 to <4 years of use: 0.57 [0.25-1.34]; 4 to <5 years of use: 0.93 [0.30-2.85; ≥5 years of use: 1.18 [0.44-3.19]; P for trend = 0.26). Use of metformin is not associated with a decreased incidence of bladder cancer. Similar methods should be used to study other cancers that have previously been identified as potentially preventable with metformin.",

To investigate whether the association reflect causality, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method was conducted. Data from genome-wide association studies were analyzed, with the exposure factor being metformin and the outcome variable being PCOS. The inverse variance weighted(IVW) was used as the primary method for MR analysis. In addition, MR-Egger, weighted median, heterogeneity tests, and sensitivity analyses were performed. The initial and validation MR analyses indicated that genetically predicted metformin treatment had no effects on PCOS. Sensitivity analyses provided additional confirmation of the reliability of the MR results. Our two-sample MR analysis did not find genetic evidence supporting a significant association between metformin treatment and PCOS.",

We evaluated outcomes in a cohort of 6225 women with T2DM with a new diagnosis of ovarian, breast or endometrial cancer from 2010 to 2019. We classified glycemic medications at time of first cancer diagnosis into 3 tiers in accordance with ADA guidelines. Approaches compared: (i) metformin (tier 1) vs. no glycemic medication, (ii) metformin vs tier 2 medications (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, SGLT2-inhibitors, DPP4-inhibitors, alpha glucosidase-inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists), (iii) metformin vs tier 3 medications (insulins, amylinomimetics), and (iv) tier 2 vs tier 3 medications. Analyses included Cox proportional-hazards models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and conditional logistic regression in a risk set-sampled nested case-control matched on T2DM duration- all modeling survival. Models were adjusted for demographics, cancer type, A1C, T2DM duration, and number of office visits and hospitalizations. Metformin was the most used medication (n = 3232) and consistently demonstrated survival benefit compared with tier 2 and 3 medications, across all methods. Tier 3-users demonstrated highest risk of death when compared to metformin rather than tier 2 [adjHR = 1.83 (95% CI: 1.58, 2.13) vs. adjHR = 1.32 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.57)], despite similar baseline profiles between tier 1 and 2 users. Metformin users experienced increased survival even after accounting for surrogates of diabetes progression. Benefit extended beyond that seen in tier 2-users. Our findings, consistent with prior studies, indicate metformin use improves survival in women with T2DM and hormonally mediated women's cancers.",

      "abstract": "Findings from studies of metformin use with risk of cancer incidence and outcome provide mixed results; with few studies examined associations by recency of diabetes diagnosis or duration of medication use. Thus, in the Women's Health Initiative, we examined these associations and further explored whether associations differ by recency of diabetes and duration of metformin use. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals. Diabetes was associated with higher risk of total invasive cancer (HR, 1.13; p < 0.001) and of several site-specific cancers (HR, 1.2-1.4, and up to over twofold). Diabetes was also associated with higher risk of death from cancer (HR, 1.46; p < 0.001). There was no overall difference in cancer incidence by diabetes therapy (p = 0.66). However, there was a lower risk of death from cancer for metformin users, compared to users of other medications, relative to women without diabetes, overall (HRs, 1.08 vs. 1.45; p = 0.007) and for breast cancer (HRs, 0.50 vs. 1.29; p = 0.05). Results also suggested that lower cancer risk associated with metformin may be evident only for a longer duration of use in certain cancer sites or subgroup populations. We provide further evidence that postmenopausal women with diabetes are at higher risk of invasive cancer and cancer death. Metformin users, particularly long-term users, may be at lower risk of developing certain cancers and dying from cancer, compared to users of other anti-diabetes medications. Future studies are needed to determine the long-term effect of metformin in cancer risk and survival from cancer.",

      "abstract": "Observational clinical studies of metformin for prevention and treatment of several cancer types have reported mixed findings. Although preclinical studies have suggested metformin may reduce head and neck cancer (HNC) proliferation, clinical evidence is limited. The objective of this large population-based study was to evaluate the relationship between metformin exposure following HNC diagnosis and all-cause mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Italian Emilia-Romagna Regional administrative healthcare database, which includes demographic, hospital and outpatient prescription information for ~4.5 million residents. Included patients were followed from the first hospital discharge (index) during the study period (01/2003-12/2012) with a diagnosis of HNC. Metformin exposure and select covariates were operationalized in a time-dependent manner during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the covariate-adjusted time-dependent association between metformin exposure and all-cause mortality. Among 7872 patients diagnosed with HNC, 708 (9.0%) were exposed to metformin after HNC diagnosis, and 3626 (46.1%) died during follow-up (median follow-up: 35.2 months). In the covariate-adjusted model, the all-cause mortality rate appeared lower (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.61-1.09) among metformin exposed patients during the 2 years post-diagnosis, while the all-cause mortality rate appeared higher (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.94-1.53) among exposed patients after 2 years post-diagnosis. Metformin was protective among patients ≤60 years of age (HR for the period of 0-2 years post-diagnosis: 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.56; HR for the period ≥2 years post-diagnosis: 0.56, 95% CI 0.26-1.22) but not in those >60 years. In this population-based study of metformin in HNC, we found a modest protective association between metformin exposure and all-cause mortality in the 2-year post-diagnosis period. Age appeared to modify the association between metformin and HNC survival.",

This study assessed whether metformin use after non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis is associated with overall survival among type II diabetic patients with NSCLC in the U.S. military health system (MHS). The study included 636 diabetic patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC diagnosed between 2002 and 2007, identified from the linked database from the Department of Defense's Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). Time-dependent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between metformin use and overall survival during follow-up. Among the 636 patients, 411 died during the follow-up. The median follow-up time was 14.6 months. Increased post-diagnosis cumulative use (per 1 year of use) conferred a significant reduction in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.65-0.88). Further analysis by duration of use revealed that compared to non-users, the lowest risk reduction occurred among patients with the longest duration of use (i.e. use for more than 2 years) (HR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.09-0.40). Finally, the reduced mortality was particularly observed only among patients who also used metformin before lung cancer diagnosis and among patients at early stage of diagnosis. Prolonged duration of metformin use in the study population was associated with improved survival, especially among early stage patients. Future research with a larger number of patients is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical data have shown the immunomodulatory effects of metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors in patients with diabetes. However, its clinical impact remains unclear in lung cancer. Between 2017 and 2021, 466 patients received ICI monotherapy. Patients were categorized into concurrent (MET; metformin or combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitor) and without concomitant (NMET; nonmetformin/DPP4 inhibitors) administration of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors groups at least 8 weeks before and during ICI therapy. The primary objectives were the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The second objective was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Among 466 patients, 89 (19.0%) and 377 (81%) were categorized into the MET and NMET groups, respectively. MET group had a significantly higher ORR (MET group: 24.7% vs. NMET group: 14.8%, p = 0.025) and longer PFS than those in the NMET group (MET group 5.1 month vs. NMET group 2.8 months, p = 0.018). After patients were stratified based on the prior line of therapy and PD L1 expression status, the PFS of the second-line therapy and PD L1 ≥50 was significantly higher in the MET than in the NMET group. The proportion of patients experiencing all-grade irAEs was numerically higher in the MET group (19.1%) than in the NMET group (14.3%), without statistical significance (p = 0.382). Concurrent use of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors with ICIs significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the incidence of irAEs in NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Published evidence indicates that individual use of metformin and statin is associated with reduced cancer mortality. However, their differential and joint effects on pancreatic cancer survival are inconclusive.<b>Methods:</b> We identified a large population-based cohort of 12,572 patients ages 65 years or older with primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed between 2008 and 2011 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare Prescription Drug Event files. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates adjusted for propensity scores were used to assess the association while controlling for potential confounders.<b>Results:</b> Of 12,572 PDAC patients, 950 (7.56%) had used metformin alone, 4,506 (35.84%) had used statin alone, and 2,445 (19.45%) were dual users. Statin use was significantly associated with improved overall survival [HR, 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-0.98], and survival was more pronounced in postdiagnosis statin users (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86). Metformin use was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.94-1.09). No beneficial effect was observed for dual users (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05).<b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest potential benefits of statins on improving survival among elderly PDAC patients; further prospective studies are warranted to corroborate the putative benefit of statin therapy in pancreatic cancer.<b>Impact:</b> Although more studies are needed to confirm our findings, our data add to the body of evidence on potential anticancer effects of statins. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(8); 1225-32. ©2017 AACR</i>.",

This study aimed to observe and analyze whether metformin use is associated with better prognosis in pancreatic cancer. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In this retrospective cohort study, all baseline data were retrieved from The Chinese Medicine Information Retrieval System (https://dc.wzhospital.cn/vpn/index.html) of The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Survival data were collected by follow-up visits and medical records. Overall survival was the primary endpoint, while progression-free survival and disease-free survival were secondary endpoints. Progression or recurrence was assessed with radiologic images. <b>Results:</b> Seventy-six metformin users and 92 metformin nonusers diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2012 to 2020 in this hospital were enrolled. The adjusted hazard ratio for overall survival for metformin users was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.76), where median overall survival was 16.0 months for metformin users versus 11.5 months for metformin nonusers. The protective effect was also found by analyzing progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.86) and disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.68). In the subgroup analysis, metformin use had a statistically significant association with prolongation of survival in stage I to II pancreatic cancer patients (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.91), but not for advanced tumor stage (hazard ratio for IV stage = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.33-1.19), after adjustment for other risk factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> Metformin use is related to favorable survival outcomes of pancreatic cancer, especially in early tumor stage.",

Although metformin has been shown to improve HRQOL in PCOS patients, it is unclear whether this effect is due to the drug itself or its metabolic benefits. This study included 66 PCOS patients from the University Medical Center Mainz, in two groups: 31 received metformin (M-group) and 35 received alternative or no treatment (C-group). HRQOL and distress were assessed at baseline and after 6 months using the Modified PCOS-Questionnaire (MPCOSQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). At baseline, the M-group had significantly worse metabolic markers, including HOMA-IR, waist circumference, Visceral Adiposity Index, and Fatty Liver Index. By follow-up, this group showed greater improvements in these markers. However, both groups improved similarly in HRQOL and distress. Regression analysis revealed that improvements in HOMA-IR and BMI were associated with better HRQOL scores. Group assignment was not a significant predictor. These findings may indicate that improvements in HRQOL and reduced distress are linked to metabolic changes associated with metformin use, underscoring the potential relevance of addressing metabolic health in treatment approaches.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether type 2 diabetes mellitus and treatment with metformin is associated with prostate cancer risk. The cohort was composed of diabetic male patients identified in the National Health Insurance Fund database during 2000-2016 and cancer cases in national Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for prostate cancers as a ratio of observed number of cancer case in people with diagnosis of diabetes to the expected number of cancer cases in the underlying general population. 2754 prostate cancers were observed versus 3111.26 expected within the period of observation entailing an SIR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.92). Significantly lower risk of prostate cancer was found in diabetes patients in all age groups, also was in metformin-users and never-users' groups, with higher risk reduction in metformin-users (SIR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.68-0.75) than in diabetes patients never-users (SIR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96). In this large population-based study, we found a significantly decreased risk of prostate cancer among men with diabetes and metformin-users.",

This study is to investigate the use of aspirin, metformin, or the combination of both is associated with delayed cancer incidence. This dataset is based on the electronic medical record of public hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were classified into 1. aspirin user, 2. metformin user, 3. both aspirin and metformin user and 4. control group with neither aspirin nor metformin used. Aspirin and/or metformin must have been taken for over 6 months in the treatment group and cancer incidences was counted at least 6 months after exposure to such medications. The primary outcome of this study was overall incidence of cancer during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were cancer incidences of specific sites, including colon/rectum, liver, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach, lung, breast, kidney, bladder and prostate. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios of cancer risks. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for the medication effects. A total of 120,971 aspirin users, 11,365 metformin users, and 6630 aspirin plus metformin users, were identified. Compare to the control groups, those who used aspirin alone demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87). Similarly, those who used metformin alone also showed an overall reduction in cancer risk (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88). Patients who received both aspirin and metformin showed the most significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.63). Metformin showed a significant reduction in cancer risk of lung, oesophagus and bladder. There is a similar decrease in overall cancer rate with the use of aspirin or metformin alone. A more significant reduction in overall cancer risk was found with the use of both agents.",

In this sub-analysis of the ARON-2 real-world study (NCT05290038), we aimed to assess the impact of concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), statins, or metformin on outcome of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) receiving second-line pembrolizumab. We collected data from the hospital medical records of patients with mUC treated with pembrolizumab as second-line therapy at 87 institutions from 22 countries. Patients were assessed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate. We carried out a survival analysis by a Cox regression model. A total of 802 patients were eligible for this retrospective study; the median follow-up time was 15.3 months. PPI users compared to non-users showed inferior PFS (4.5 vs. 7.2 months, p = 0.002) and OS (8.7 vs. 14.1 months, p < 0.001). Concomitant PPI use remained a significant predictor of PFS and OS after multivariate Cox analysis. The use of statins or metformin was not associated with response or survival. Our study results suggest a significant prognostic impact of concomitant PPI use in mUC patients receiving pembrolizumab in the real-world context. The mechanism of this interaction warrants further elucidation.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer and with reduced survival after cancer diagnosis. We examined the hypotheses that survival after a diagnosis of solid-tumor cancer is reduced in those with diabetes when compared with those without diabetes, and that treatment with metformin influences survival after cancer diagnosis. Data were obtained from >350 U.K. primary care practices in a retrospective cohort study. All individuals with or without diabetes who developed a first tumor after January 1990 were identified and records were followed to December 2009. Diabetes was further stratified by treatment regimen. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare all-cause mortality from all cancers and from specific cancers. Of 112,408 eligible individuals, 8,392 (7.5%) had type 2 diabetes. Cancer mortality was increased in those with diabetes, compared with those without (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 1.06-1.13]). Mortality was increased in those with breast (1.32 [1.17-1.49]) and prostate cancer (1.19 [1.08-1.31]) but decreased in lung cancer (0.84 [0.77-0.92]). When analyzed by diabetes therapy, mortality was increased relative to nondiabetes in those on monotherapy with sulfonylureas (1.13 [1.05-1.21]) or insulin (1.13 [1.01-1.27]) but reduced in those on metformin monotherapy (0.85 [0.78-0.93]). This study confirmed that type 2 diabetes was associated with poorer prognosis after incident cancer, but that the association varied according to diabetes therapy and cancer site. Metformin was associated with survival benefit both in comparison with other treatments for diabetes and in comparison with a nondiabetic population.",

A total of 65,754 age- and gender-matched patients without diabetes and no previous cancer diagnosis were extracted from the database. We compared cancer risk among the subjects who had no diabetes, had type 2 diabetes but were not on diabetes drugs, used metformin only, used antidiabetic drugs other than metformin, or used metformin in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. Our results revealed dose-dependent effects of metformin on cancer risk and cancer onset times. A significant decrease in cancer risk was found in the monotherapy group who received more than 360 defined daily doses (DDDs) of metformin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.66). The greatest decrease in cancer risk was observed in patients who took more than 1080 DDDs (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.84). Significantly greater dose-dependent effects were seen in patients who used metformin in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. The magnitude of cancer risk reduction and prolonged cancer onset times produced by metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes depended on the dose of metformin, regardless of whether metformin was used alone or combined with other antidiabetic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (diabetic MASLD) frequently coexist and worsen liver and non-liver outcomes, but effective pharmacological therapies are limited. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) on liver and non-liver outcomes among patients with diabetic MASLD. This population-based cohort study retrieved patients with diabetic MASLD from Merative Marketscan Research Databases (April 2013 and December 2021). The active comparator was other glucose-lowering drugs (oGLDs). Primary outcomes were liver complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis, as well as non-liver complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and non-liver cancer. Propensity score matching was applied and Cox regression models were conducted. Compared with oGLD, SGLT-2i users had significantly lower risk of HCC (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93), liver cirrhosis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.84), CVD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.85) and CKD (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.70), non-liver cancer (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86). Compared with patients without metformin and SGLT-2i, a stepwise decreasing risk was observed in users of either metformin or SGLT-2i (HRs 0.76-0.97) and in users of both medications (HRs 0.58-0.79). The lower risk also was shown in liver decompensation, compensated cirrhosis, major CVD, end-stage renal disease and specific common cancers (HRs 0.61-0.84). In a nationwide cohort, SGLT-2i users were associated with a substantially lower risk of liver and non-liver complications than oGLD users among patients with diabetic MASLD. The risk was further reduced with concomitant metformin use.",

The glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class of pharmaceuticals are effective agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and for achieving weight loss, but the association of GLP-1RAs with the incident risk of 13 OACs is unclear. To compare the incident risk of each of the 13 OACs in patients with T2D who were prescribed GLP-1RAs vs insulins or metformin. This retrospective cohort study was based on a nationwide multicenter database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 113 million US patients. The study population included 1 651 452 patients with T2D who had no prior diagnosis of OACs and were prescribed GLP-1RAs, insulins, or metformin during March 2005 to November 2018. Data analysis was conducted on April 26, 2024. Prescription of GLP-1RAs, insulins, or metformin. Incident (first-time) diagnosis of each of the 13 OACs occurring during a 15-year follow-up after the exposure was examined using Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with censoring applied. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and 95% CIs were calculated. All models were adjusted for confounders at baseline by propensity-score matching baseline covariates. In the study population of 1 651 452 patients with T2D (mean [SD] age, 59.8 [15.1] years; 827 873 [50.1%] male and 775 687 [47.0%] female participants; 5780 [0.4%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 65 893 [4.0%] Asian, 281 242 [17.0%] Black, 13 707 [0.8%] Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 1 000 780 [60.6%] White participants), GLP-1RAs compared with insulin were associated with a significant risk reduction in 10 of 13 OACs, including in gallbladder cancer (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83), meningioma (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.74), pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.33-0.50), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.61), ovarian cancer (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74), colorectal cancer (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.64), multiple myeloma (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77), esophageal cancer (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86), endometrial cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91), and kidney cancer (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91). Although not statistically significant, the HR for stomach cancer was less than 1 among patients who took GLP-1RAs compared with those who took insulin (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.03). GLP-1RAs were not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer or thyroid cancer. Of those cancers that showed a decreased risk among patients taking GLP-1RAs compared with those taking insulin, HRs for patients taking GLP-1RAs vs those taking metformin for colorectal and gallbladder cancer were less than 1, but the risk reduction was not statistically significant. Compared with metformin, GLP-1RAs were not associated with a decreased risk of any cancers, but were associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27-1.87). In this study, GLP-1RAs were associated with lower risks of specific types of OACs compared with insulins or metformin in patients with T2D. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies for the prevention of certain OACs.",

      "abstract": "In the USA, the prolonged effective survival of cancer population has brought significant attention to the rising risk of cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in this population. This heightened risk underscores the urgent need for research into effective pharmacological interventions for cancer survivors. Notably, metformin, a well-known metabolic regulator with pleiotropic effects, has shown protective effects against cardiometabolic disorders in diabetic individuals. Despite these promising indications, evidence supporting its efficacy in improving cardiometabolic outcomes in cancer survivors remains scarce. A prospective cohort was established using a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors enrolled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), spanning 2003 to 2018. Outcomes were derived from patient interviews, physical examinations, and public-access linked mortality archives up to 2019. The Oxidative Balance Score was utilized to assess participants' levels of oxidative stress. To evaluate the correlations between metformin use and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and related mortality, survival analysis of cardiometabolic mortality was performed by Cox proportional hazards model, and cross-sectional analysis of cardiometabolic diseases outcomes was performed using logistic regression models. Interaction analyses were conducted to explore the specific pharmacological mechanism of metformin. Among 3995 cancer survivors (weighted population, 21,671,061, weighted mean [SE] age, 62.62 [0.33] years; 2119 [53.04%] females; 2727 [68.26%] Non-Hispanic White individuals), 448 reported metformin usage. During the follow-up period of up to 17 years (median, 6.42 years), there were 1233 recorded deaths, including 481 deaths from cardiometabolic causes. Multivariable models indicated that metformin use was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.81) and cardiometabolic (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.97) mortality compared with metformin nonusers. Metformin use was also correlated with a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28-0.59), stroke (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74), hypertension (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52), and coronary heart disease (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.78). The observed inverse associations were consistent across subgroup analyses in four specific cancer populations identified as cardiometabolic high-risk groups. Interaction analyses suggested that metformin use as compared to non-use may counter-balance oxidative stress. In this cohort study involving a nationally representative population of US cancer survivors, metformin use was significantly correlated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic diseases, all-cause mortality, and cardiometabolic mortality.",

This population-based cohort study included new cases of esophageal cancer reported in Sweden from 2006 to 2018 with follow-up through 2019. Diabetes status and metformin use were analyzed in relation to all-cause and disease-specific mortality using multivariable Cox regression. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, obesity, comorbidity, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or statins. For comparison reasons, 3 other antidiabetic medications were also analyzed (ie, sulfonylureas, insulin, and thiazolidinedione). Among 4851 esophageal cancer patients (8404 person-years), 4072 (84%) died during follow-up. Compared with esophageal cancer patients with diabetes but not using metformin, decreased all-cause mortality was indicated among nondiabetic patients (without metformin) (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77 to 0.96) and diabetic patients who used metformin (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.00). The hazard ratios of all-cause mortality decreased with a higher daily dose of metformin (Ptrend = .04). The corresponding hazard ratios for disease-specific mortality were similar but slightly attenuated. The results were also similar in separate analyses of esophageal cancer patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, with tumor stage I-II or III-IV, and in those who had or had not undergone surgery. No associations with mortality outcomes were found for use of sulfonylureas, insulin, or thiazolidinedione. Diabetes was associated with an increased all-cause mortality, whereas metformin use was associated with decreased all-cause mortality among esophageal cancer patients. More research is needed to determine if metformin affects survival in esophageal cancer.",

While metformin has been associated with lower CRC risk in general diabetic populations, its effect in patients with coexisting IBD and diabetes-a group at compounded risk-remains unclear. We conducted a nationwide cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Among 241 590 adults newly diagnosed with IBD between 2008 and 2019, 1695 metformin users were matched to 1695 non-metformin users after applying strict eligibility criteria and 1:1 propensity score matching. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for incident CRC and all-cause mortality were estimated using time-dependent Cox models and Fine-Gray competing risk analysis. Dose-response was assessed via restricted cubic splines. Metformin use was associated with a 56% lower risk of CRC (aHR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.68), with similar findings in competing risk models (subdistribution HR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.76). All-cause mortality was reduced by 32% (aHR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.80). CRC risk decreased with higher cumulative exposure; those in the highest quartile had a 67% lower risk (aHR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.57). The lowest CRC risk occurred at ∼0.4 defined daily dose/day (∼800 mg/day). Metformin use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in patients with IBD. These findings suggest a potential chemopreventive role, but confirmation from prospective randomized studies is needed before drawing causal inferences.",

Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic drug, but not other anti-diabetic drugs, has been associated with reduced risk of breast and of colon cancers in some, but not in other, studies. Data from two large-scale, population-based, case-control studies of breast and colorectal cancers etiology, conducted in Northern Israel since 1998 were analyzed to evaluate the association between regular use (>3 times) of metformin prior to diagnosis and risk of developing cancer. The multivariate analyses for both cancer sites included age, family history of breast/colorectal cancer, history of diabetes, sports participation, fruits/vegetables consumption, aspirin and statins use, and for breast cancer, also included use of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormones and number of pregnancies. Use of metformin and diabetes status were determined based on valid electronic medical records of the participants. Metformin use prior to diagnosis of cancer was associated with a decrease in risk of both breast cancer (OR = 0.821, 0.726-0.928, p = 0.002) and colorectal cancer (OR = 0.754, 0.623-0.912, p = 0.004). An inverse association was not identified with use of other anti-diabetic medications. Diabetes was found to be associated with risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.204, 1.014-1.431, p = 0.034) but not of breast cancer. No dose response by years of use of metformin was found. These analyses of large population-based studies provide evidence of a strong inverse association of metformin with breast and, even more so, with colorectal cancer risk.",

We investigated whether metformin use was associated with decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality in lung cancer patients. This study included newly diagnosed lung cancer patients (identified from English National Cancer Data Repository, 1998-2009) with type 2 diabetes (based on UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink prescriptions and diagnosis records). Lung cancer deaths occurring up to 2012 were identified using Office of National Statistics mortality data and the association between metformin use (before and after diagnosis) and risk of lung cancer-specific mortality was calculated using Cox regression models. In analysis of 533 patients, we found a weak non-significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality with metformin use after diagnosis (adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68-1.09). No association was evident for metformin use before diagnosis and cancer-specific mortality in analysis of 1350 patients (adjusted HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86, 1.11). Associations were similar by duration of use. In addition, after adjustment for potential confounders, there was little evidence of an association between the use of other anti-diabetic medications (either before or after diagnosis) and lung cancer-specific mortality; including sulfonylureas, insulin or other anti-diabetic medications (such as thiazolidinediones). Overall, the results from this population-based study provide little evidence of a protective association between metformin use and cancer mortality in lung cancer patients.",

Metformin has been used in an attempt to improve pregnancy outcomes. Our study aims to explore childbirth experiences in women with PCOS compared with a reference population. It also explores the potential influence of metformin, obesity, pregnancy complications, and the duration and mode of birth on childbirth experiences. This study is a cohort study combining data from two randomized trials conducted in Norway, Sweden and Iceland. The PregMet2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01587378) investigated the use of metformin vs. placebo in pregnant women with PCOS. The Labour Progression Study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02221427) compared the WHO partograph to Zhang's guidelines for progression of labor and were used as the reference population. A total of 365 women with PCOS and 3604 reference women were included. Both studies used the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Main outcome measures were total CEQ score and four domain scores. The CEQ scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U test for women in Robson group 1 with PCOS (n = 131) and reference women (n = 3604). CEQ scores were also compared between metformin-treated (n = 180) and placebo-treated (n = 185) women with PCOS, and for different subgroups of women with PCOS. There was no difference in total CEQ score between women with PCOS and reference women-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW)-odds 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-1.17). We detected no difference in CEQ scores between the metformin- and placebo-treated women with PCOS (WMW-odds 1.13, 95% CI 0.89-1.43). Complications in pregnancy did not affect CEQ (WMW-odds 1, 95% CI 0.76-1.31). Higher body mass index (WMW-odds 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96), longer duration of labor (WMW-odds 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96), and cesarean section (WMW-odds 0.29, 95% CI 0.2-0.42) were associated with lower CEQ scores in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS experience childbirth similarly to the reference women. Metformin did not influence childbirth experience in women with PCOS, neither did pregnancy complications. Obesity, long duration of labor or cesarean section had a negative impact on childbirth experience.",

      "abstract": "Metformin has been associated with improved colorectal cancer survival, but investigations are limited by small numbers of patients and confounding by diabetic severity. We examined the association between metformin use and overall survival (OS) in patients with diabetes and colorectal cancer in a large population of U.S. veterans, while adjusting for measures of diabetic severity. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer from January 2001 to December 2008 were identified from the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry. Multivariable models were used to examine the adjusted association of OS with diabetes and use of antidiabetic medications. There were 21,352 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer identified (n = 16,355 nondiabetic patients, n = 2,038 diabetic patients on metformin, n = 2,136 diabetic patients on medications other than metformin, n = 823 diabetic patients not on antidiabetic medication). Diabetic patients had a significantly worse OS than nondiabetic patients, but metformin users had only a 10% increase in death (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17, P = 0.004), as compared with 22% for users of other antidiabetic medications (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29, P < 0.0001). Among colorectal cancer patients with diabetes, metformin users had a 13% improved OS versus patients taking other antidiabetic medications (HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95, P = 0.003), while diabetic patients not on any antidiabetic medications did not differ with respect to OS (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.02; 95% CI, 0.90-1.15, P = 0.76). Among diabetics with colorectal cancer, metformin use is associated with improved survival, despite adjustments for diabetes severity and other risk factors. These data lend further support to the conduct of randomized studies of possible anticancer effects of metformin among patients with colorectal cancer.

Disease management relies on glycemic control through diet, exercise, and pharmacological intervention. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of glycemic control and the use of glucose-lowering medication on the risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N=9486) between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2009 were identified and data on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, glucose), glucose-lowering medication use (insulin, metformin, sulfonylurea), age, BMI, date of diabetes diagnosis, insurance status, comorbidities, smoking history, location of residence, and cancer diagnoses were electronically abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the relationship between glycemic control, including medication use, and cancer risk. The results varied by cancer type and medication exposure. There was no association between glycemic control and breast or colon cancer; however, prostate cancer risk was significantly higher with better glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7.0%). Insulin use was associated with increased colon cancer incidence in women, but not with colon cancer in men or breast or prostate cancer risk. Metformin exposure was associated with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence, but had no association with colon cancer risk. Sulfonylurea exposure was not associated with risk of any type of cancer. The data reported here support hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, as a major diabetes-related factor associated with increased risk of breast and colon cancer. In contrast, hyperglycemia appears to be protective in the case of prostate cancer.",

This study identified diabetic adults with PCa receiving any ADT attending public hospitals in Hong Kong between December 1999 and March 2021 retrospectively, with follow-up until September 2021. Patients with <6 months of medical castration without subsequent bilateral orchidectomy, <6 months of concurrent metformin use and ADT, or missing baseline HbA1c were excluded. Metformin users had ≥180 days of concurrent metformin use and ADT, while non-users had no concurrent metformin use and ADT or never used metformin. The primary outcome was PCa-related mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. The study used inverse probability treatment weighting to balance covariates. The analyzed cohort consisted of 1971 patients (1284 metformin users and 687 non-users; mean age 76.2 ± 7.8 years). Over a mean follow-up of 4.1 ± 3.2 years, metformin users had significantly lower risks of PCa-related mortality (weighted hazard ratio [wHR]: 0.49 [95% confidence interval, CI:  0.39-0.61], p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (wHR 0.53 [0.46-0.61], p < 0.001), independent of diabetic control or status of chronic kidney disease. Such effects appeared stronger in patients with less advanced PCa, which is reflected by the absence of androgen receptor antagonist or chemotherapy use (p value for interaction: 0.017 for PCa-related mortality; 0.048 for all-cause mortality). Metformin use concurrent with ADT was associated with lower risks of mortality in Asian, diabetic patients with PCa.",

Hazard ratios of aspirin, statins, and metformin use for PC incidence and PC mortality were calculated with adjustment for simultaneous drug use. Cumulative use of each drug was inserted as time-dependent variable with 2-year time windows. Aspirin use ≥ 1.5 year (per 2-year) was associated with borderline decrease in PC mortality when compared to non-users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-1.02). Statins use was not associated with either PC incidence or PC mortality. Metformin ever-use was associated with decreased PC incidence compared with non-diabetics (aHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96). Diabetics who were not using metformin or using low cumulative doses had higher PC mortality than non-diabetics (aHR 2.01, 95% CI 1.44-2.81, and aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.07-2.69, respectively). However, subjects with higher cumulative doses of metformin did not show increased PC mortality. In conclusion, metformin use was associated with lower PC incidence. Use of aspirin and that of metformin among diabetic patients were associated with lower PC mortality.",

      "abstract": "While the association between metformin and mortality in obesity-related cancers (ORC: breast (BrCa), colorectal (CRC), endometrial (ECa), and ovarian (OCa)) remains inconsistent, the impact of weight loss medication (WLM) on mortality in ORC is largely unexplored, particularly among older women. This study aims to investigate the association between pre-diagnostic use of metformin and WLM with all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in older women with ORC. A retrospective cohort of 63,907 women (≥ 65 years) with ORC was identified using SEER-Medicare 2007-2015 data. Pre-diagnostic prescriptions of metformin and WLM were ascertained, and inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score (IPTW-PS) was utilized to balance baseline patient characteristics. Cox proportional hazards and competing-risks models were conducted. Metformin was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.86; 95% CI: 1.81-1.92) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.63-1.77). Likewise, WLM was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.64; 95% CI: 1.59-1.71) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.48-1.62). Dual use of metformin and WLM was associated with all-cause- (HR:1.39; 95% CI: 1.34-1.45) and ORC-specific mortality (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21-1.53). Significant associations were observed in ORC subgroup analyses, except that WLM was inversely associated with ECa-specific morality. Pre-diagnostic metformin and WLM were associated with an increased mortality risk in older women with ORC, with effects more pronounced among metformin users. Further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these findings.",

      "abstract": "To examine the association between metformin use and mortality in patients with diabetes and cervical cancer. Using Ontario health databases, a retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted in women with diabetes ≥ age 66 years diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1997 and 2010. The association between metformin exposure and cervical cancer-specific mortality was examined using Fine-Gray regression models, with noncancer death as a competing risk and cumulative metformin use as a time-varying exposure. The association with overall mortality was examined using Cox regression models. Among the 181 women with diabetes and cervical cancer, there were 129 deaths, including 61 cervical cancer-specific deaths. The median follow-up was 5.8 years (interquartile range 4.2-9.6 years) for surviving patients. Cumulative dose of metformin after cervical cancer diagnosis was independently associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality in a dose-dependent fashion [HR 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.98; and HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.996 per each additional 365 g of metformin use, respectively]. There was no significant association between cumulative use of other antidiabetic drugs and cervical cancer-specific mortality. This study suggests an association between cumulative metformin use after cervical cancer diagnosis and lower cervical cancer-specific and overall mortality among older women with diabetes. Cumulative dose of metformin use after cervical cancer diagnosis among older women with diabetes may be associated with a significant decrease in mortality. This finding has important implications if validated prospectively, as metformin is inexpensive and can be easily combined with standard treatment for cervical cancer.",

      "abstract": "Few studies suggest that metformin decreases cancer mortality in type-2 diabetic patients (T2DP). We explored the association between the type and duration of antidiabetic therapies and cancer and other-than-cancer mortality in a T2DP cohort, taking into account the competing risks between different causes of death and multiple potential confounding effects. The mortality rates were compared with the general population from the same area. In 1995, all T2DP (n = 3685) at our diabetes clinic in Turin (∼12% of all T2DP in the city), without cancer at baseline, were identified. Vital status was assessed after a mean 4.5-year follow-up. Metformin users had greater adiposity, while insulin users had more co-morbidities. All-cause- and cancer-related deaths occurred in: 9.2 and 1.6% of metformin users, 13.1 and 3.0% of sulfonylureas users and 26.8 and 4.8% of insulin users, respectively. In a Cox regression model for competing risks, adjusted for propensity score, metformin users showed a lower cancer mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.94], while insulin was positively associated with other-than-cancer mortality (HR = 1.56; 95%CI 1.22-1.99). Each 5-year metformin exposure was associated with a reduction in cancer death by 0.73, whereas every 5-year insulin exposure was associated with 1.25-fold increase in other-than-cancer death. Standardized mortality ratios for cancer and other-than-cancer mortality in metformin users were 43.6 (95%CI 25.8-69.0) and 99.1 (95%CI 79.3-122.5), respectively, in comparison with the general population. Metformin users showed a lower risk of cancer-related mortality than not users or patients on diet only; this may represent another reason to choose metformin as a first-line therapy in T2DP.",

The impact of comedication on immunotherapy efficacy has been studied in retrospective series, but the results are often biased by the lack of information on the independent prognostic impact of comedication weighted for comorbidities and disease aggressiveness. The IFCT-1502 CLINIVO study is a nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received nivolumab in second or later lines of treatment as part of the French Expanded Access Program. We retrieved comedication prescriptions from 90 days before to 30 days after the first nivolumab administration via the French national healthcare database. We report the results of a comprehensive post hoc analysis investigating the impact of comedication on treatment response considering well-known negative prognostic factors. We selected 753 patients whose medical and comedication records were available. According to the multivariate analysis, morphine and corticosteroids > 20 mg per day were associated with poor overall survival regardless of disease aggressiveness. Conversely, metformin was associated with better overall survival. Morphine and corticosteroids were also found to be associated with shorter real-world progression-free survival according to multivariate analysis, as were poor prognostic factors such as liver metastasis and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score ≥ 2. Our study confirmed the negative impact of morphine and high-dose corticosteroids on immunotherapy efficacy regardless of poor prognostic factors related to disease aggressiveness. On the other hand, our findings suggested a positive impact of metformin on immunotherapy outcomes.",

Overall, 493,704 men and 502,139 women, covered by the National Health Insurance, without colon cancer were followed from 2003 to 2005. Cox regression evaluated the adjusted relative risk (RR), considering confounders and detection examinations. Even though diabetes patients had a significantly higher probability of receiving examinations that could lead to the detection of colon cancer, they had a significantly higher risk (24%) of this cancer after adjustment. Metformin users had a significantly lower risk (27%) of colon cancer. While comparing patients with diabetes for <1, 1-3, and ≥ 3 years to nondiabetes individuals, the adjusted RR (95% confidence interval) was 1.308 (1.020-1.679), 1.087 (0.900-1.313), and 1.185 (1.055-1.330) respectively. The higher risk among those with diabetes for <1 year suggested a possible reverse causality or a link with prediabetes. However, diabetes still might play some role in the development of colon cancer in those with diabetes for ≥ 3 years. The duration of metformin use showed an inverse trend, with a significant RR of 0.643 (0.490-0.845) in users for ≥ 3 years, when compared with nonusers. In addition, metformin may reduce colon cancer risk associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a surrogate for smoking). Following adjustment for potential detection bias and other covariates, diabetes remains a significant risk factor for colon cancer. Metformin may protect against colon cancer.",

We used a population-based retrospective cohort design. Data were obtained from several Ontario health care administrative databases. Within a cohort of men older than age 66 years with incident diabetes who subsequently developed PC, we examined the effect of duration of antidiabetic medication exposure after PC diagnosis on all-cause and PC-specific mortality. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by using a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model to estimate effects. The cohort consisted of 3,837 patients. Median age at diagnosis of PC was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72 to 79 years). During a median follow-up of 4.64 years (IQR, 2.7 to 7.1 years), 1,343 (35%) died, and 291 patients (7.6%) died as a result of PC. Cumulative duration of metformin treatment after PC diagnosis was associated with a significant decreased risk of PC-specific and all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. Adjusted HR for PC-specific mortality was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89) for each additional 6 months of metformin use. The association with all-cause mortality was also significant but declined over time from an HR of 0.76 in the first 6 months to 0.93 between 24 and 30 months. There was no relationship between cumulative use of other antidiabetic drugs and either outcome. Increased cumulative duration of metformin exposure after PC diagnosis was associated with decreases in both all-cause and PC-specific mortality among diabetic men.",

Nationwide, nested case-control study. From a nationwide cohort of 264 708 individuals, we identified 1737 incident glaucoma cases and matched them to 8685 glaucoma-free controls, all aged more than 21 years and treated with metformin and a second-line antihyperglycemic drug formulation, with no history of glaucoma, eye trauma, or eye surgery. Cases were incidence-density-matched to 5 controls by birth year, sex, and date of second-line treatment initiation. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for glaucoma, defined by first-time diagnosis, first-time use of glaucoma-specific medication, or first-time glaucoma-specific surgical intervention. Compared with the reference group, who received treatments other than GLP-1RA, individuals who were exposed to GLP-1RA treatment exhibited a lower risk of incident glaucoma (HR, 0.81; CI, 0.70-0.94; P = 0.006). Prolonged treatment extending beyond 3 years lowered the risk even further (HR, 0.71; CI, 0.55-0.91; P = 0.007). Treatment with GLP-1RA for 0 to 1 year (HR, 0.89; CI, 0.70-1.14; P = 0.35) and 1 to 3 years (HR, 0.85; CI, 0.67-1.06; P = 0.15) was not significant. Exposure to GLP-1RA was associated with a lower risk of developing glaucoma compared with receiving other second-line antihyperglycemic medication.

      "abstract": "More than 30% of patients with breast cancer develop lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), significantly impacting their quality of life. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM), which contribute to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, may also affect lymphatic endothelium. Preclinical studies suggest that metformin, a common DM treatment, may reduce lymphedema risk. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with breast cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who underwent ALND from January 2004 to December 2022 (4,882 patients overall). We stratified patients according to whether they were diagnosed with DM at the time of surgery, and if so, whether they were receiving metformin. We also conducted univariable and multivariable analyses of patient demographics for the overall cohort and the metformin vs no-metformin DM subgroups. Of the 407 patients with diabetes at the time of ALND, 250 (61%) were receiving metformin and 157 (39%) were not. Although having diabetes at the time of ALND was a significant risk factor for lymphedema on univariable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66, p < 0.001) and multivariable (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.02, p = 0.001) analysis, metformin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in lymphedema risk (univariable HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94, p = 0.023; multivariable HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89, p = 0.010).

      "abstract": "Investigation of new drugs (INDs) is a tremendously inefficient process in terms of time and cost. Drug repositioning is another method used to investigate potential new agents in well-known drugs. This study assessed the survival impact of metformin medication on ovarian cancer. A national sample cohort of the Korean National Health Insurance Service Data was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyzing hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for underlying diseases and medications as confounding factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). A total of 866 eligible patients were included from among 1,025,340 cohort participants. Among them, 101 (11.7%) were metformin users. No difference in OS was observed between non-users and users. No difference in OS was observed according to age and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Long-term metformin use (≥720 days) was associated with better OS (adjusted HR=0.244; 95% CI=0.090-0.664; p=0.006). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that long-term metformin use was an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS (HR=0.193; 95% CI=0.070-0.528; p=0.001) but not for CSS (HR=0.599; 95% CI=0.178-2.017; p=0.408). Long-term metformin use reduced all-cause mortality, but not CSS in ovarian cancer. Whether metformin itself reduces deaths because of ovarian cancer requires further investigation.",

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin, widely used antidiabetic therapies, have demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects. Their comparative effectiveness in dementia prevention remains unknown. - This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated network, analyzing de-identified records from over 98 healthcare organizations. Adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or metformin as first-line therapy were propensity score-matched (1:1). The primary outcome was overall dementia incidence, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other subtypes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Time-to-event outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. - Among 74,975 matched patients in each cohort, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia: 2.7 % vs. 6.9 %: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.80 [95 % CI 0.76;0.84]. Reductions were observed in vascular dementia (0.8 % vs. 2.0 %; aHR 0.87), Alzheimer's dementia (1.1 % vs. 3.2 %; aHR, 0.76), and all-cause mortality (6.8 % vs. 15.4 %; aHR, 0.92). Benefits were pronounced in older adults, particularly those aged ≥80 years. - SGLT2is significantly reduced dementia risk and mortality compared to metformin in T2D patients. These findings suggest SGLT2is may offer superior neuroprotective benefits, underscoring their potential as a first-line therapy for T2D. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.",

This study compared 5-year mortality, composite hepatic decompensation risk, and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence in patients with diabetes and cirrhosis who were either on metformin monotherapy or on dual metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-I) therapy. This retrospective study used the TriNetX Research Network to identify propensity score-matched patients treated with either metformin or dual metformin and SGLT2-I therapy. Our outcomes were all-cause mortality, a composite of hepatic decompensation events, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence over 5 years. We estimated hazard ratios within each cohort with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Kaplan-Meier estimates for time-to-event distributions with Log-rank tests. We were able to stratify our cohorts by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. We further investigated a subset of diabetic patients with cirrhosis due to MASH. In our propensity score-matched cohorts of type 2 diabetes patients with cirrhosis, those on dual metformin and SGLT2-I therapy had decreased risk for mortality (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.81), reduced composite risk of becoming decompensated (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.43-0.93) and less than half the risk for developing HCC (HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.21-0.88) compared to those on mono metformin therapy. We did not find a difference between mono or dual therapy treatment for mortality, decompensation, or HCC risks in the subset of patients with MASH cirrhosis. Dual metformin and SGLT2-I treatment in type 2 diabetes patients with cirrhosis are associated with improved mortality and hepatic complications.",

Our study consisted of 4572 men (Black = 1352, White = 3192, Other Race = 28) diagnosed with advanced cancer (T4/M1/N1) between 1999 and 2013 in the Veteran Health Administration. The association between post-diagnostic (1) metformin and (2) statin use with all-cause and PCa-specific mortality was examined using multivariable, time-varying Cox Proportional Hazard Models. In a secondary analysis, models were stratified by race. Post-diagnostic metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.84, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.73, 0.96) and PCa-specific death (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91). In stratified analyses, the inverse association between post-diagnostic metformin use and both all-cause PCa-specific mortality was limited to White men. Post-diagnostic statin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.83) and PCa-specific mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.81). In stratified analyses, similar inverse associations were observed for post-diagnostic statin use and all-cause and PCa-specific mortality in both Black and White men. Post diagnostic metformin and statin use may prevent progression to lethal prostate cancer in men with advanced prostate cancer.",

We assessed if metformin is associated with reduced incidence of severe COVID-19 for patients with prediabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), common diseases that increase the risk of severe COVID-19. This observational, retrospective study utilized EHR data from 52 hospitals for COVID-19 patients with PCOS or prediabetes treated with metformin or levothyroxine/ondansetron (controls). After balancing via inverse probability score weighting, associations with COVID-19 severity were assessed by logistic regression. In the prediabetes cohort, when compared to levothyroxine, metformin was associated with a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19 with \"mild-ED\" or worse (OR [95% CI]: 0.636, [0.455-0.888]) and \"moderate\" or worse severity (0.493 [0.339-0.718]). Compared to ondansetron, metformin was associated with lower incidence of \"mild-ED\" or worse severity (0.039 [0.026-0.057]), \"moderate\" or worse (0.045 [0.03-0.069]), \"severe\" or worse (0.183 [0.077-0.431]), and \"mortality/hospice\" (0.223 [0.071-0.694]). For PCOS, metformin showed no significant differences in severity compared to levothyroxine, but was associated with a significantly lower incidence of \"mild-ED\" or worse (0.101 [0.061-0.166]), and \"moderate\" or worse (0.094 [0.049-0.18]) COVID-19 outcome compared to ondansetron. Metformin use is associated with less severe COVID-19 in patients with prediabetes or PCOS.",

We aimed to analyze the effect of metformin use on the outcome of sunitinib treatment in diabetic patients with mRCC. We performed a retrospective study of diabetic patients with mRCC, who were treated with sunitinib in 8 centers across 2 countries. Patients were divided into metformin users and nonusers. The effect of metformin use on response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), was tested. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses of the association between clinicopathologic factors and metformin use, and outcome were performed using the entire patient cohort. Between 2004 and 2014, 108 diabetic patients with mRCC were treated with sunitinib. There were 52 metformin users (group 1) and 56 nonusers (group 2). The groups were balanced regarding clinicopathologic factors. Clinical benefit (partial response + stable disease) in group 1 versus 2 was 96% versus 84% (P = .054). Median PFS was 15 versus 11.5 months (P = .1). Median OS was 32 versus 21 months (P = .001). In multivariate analyses of the entire patient cohort (n = 108), factors associated with PFS were active smoking and pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 3. Factors associated with OS were metformin use (hazard ratio, 0.21; P < .0001), Heng risk, active smoking, liver metastases, and pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 3. Metformin might improve the OS of diabetic patients with mRCC who are treated with sunitinib.",

To validate these associations, we evaluated whether these medications were associated with clinical outcome in a Canadian cohort of BC patients. This is a retrospective cohort study on BC patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) in Québec province in 2000-2015, as registered in the provincial health administration databases. Medication use was considered chronic when prescribed for ≥ 1 year. Overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and recurrence-free (RFS) survival were compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Covariates included age, Charlson's comorbidity index, region of residence, year of RC, distance to hospital, hospital type, hospital and surgeon annual RC volume, neoadjuvant chemotherapy use, and type of bladder diversion, as well as mutual adjustment for concomitant comedication use (statins, NSAIDs, metformin, and prednisone). Of 3742 patients included, 293, 420, and 1503 patients chronically used prednisone, metformin, and NSAIDs before surgery, respectively. In multivariable analyses, preoperative prednisone use was associated with improved OS (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.55-0.82), DSS (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.45-0.76), and RFS (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.47-0.78). Patients who chronically used metformin preoperatively had a worse OS (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.55), DSS (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.10-1.72), and RFS (HR 1.41, 95%CI 1.13-1.74). Preoperative, chronic NSAID use was not significantly associated with all clinical outcomes, with adjusted HRs for OS, DSS, and RFS of 1.10 (95%CI 0.95-1.27), 1.24 (95%CI 1.03-1.48), and 1.22 (95%CI 1.03-1.45), respectively. Directionality of findings was similar when stratifying by comedication use in the year following surgery. Results were similar after propensity-score matching too. In our Canadian cohort of BC undergoing RC, chronic prednisone use was associated with improved clinical outcomes, while metformin and NSAID were not.",

We used data from the Danish national registries (1996-2008) to identify adult female patients diagnosed with breast cancer who were prescribed antidiabetic medication. We performed multivariate Coxproportional hazard regression to assess all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality risks associated with metformin exposure. In a secondary analysis, we stratified use of metformin according to the cumulative number of prescriptions. Of the 1058 breast cancer patients 349 died during follow-up, with breast cancer listed as the primary cause of death for 152 cases. Compared to non-use, current metformin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.58-0.96). For breast cancer-specific mortality, a non-significant risk reduction (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.59-1.29) was observed, which became significant after stratification according to cumulative number of prescriptions. An increased risk of both overall and breast cancer-specific mortality was observed in the first 12 months after discontinuation of metformin. We observed a nonsignificant reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality associated with metformin exposure among breast cancer patients treated with antidiabetic drugs. However, our findings suggest that long-term metformin use may have a beneficial effect on survival in patients with breast cancer. Further confirmation of these findings is needed.",

Type 2 diabetes patients newly diagnosed during 1999-2005 and with 2 or more prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs were enrolled from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. A total of 173 917 ever-users and 21 900 never-users of metformin were identified (unmatched cohort). A 1:1 matched-pair cohort of 21 900 ever-users and 21 900 never-users based on a propensity score (PS) was created. Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using the PS. In addition, interactions with aspirin and statin were evaluated. In the unmatched cohort, 619 never-users and 2642 ever-users developed HCC, with a respective incidence of 668.0 and 330.7 per 100 000 person-years and an overall hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.54). The hazard ratios for the first (<25.7 months), second (25.7-56.9 months) and third (>56.9 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 0.89 (0.81-0.98), 0.50 (0.46-0.56) and 0.23 (0.21-0.26) respectively. Analyses of the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of 0.76 (0.67-0.85), and the hazard ratios for the respective tertiles were 1.39 (1.19-1.62), 0.77 (0.65-0.91) and 0.37 (0.30-0.45). Aspirin and statin were observed to have a significant interaction with metformin. Metformin was associated with a reduced risk of HCC in a dose-response pattern. Users of both metformin and aspirin or metformin and statin had the lowest risk.",

      "abstract": "Previous population-based studies have demonstrated an association between metformin use and improved survival among diabetic patients with cancer. We sought to analyze the effects of diabetes and its treatment in terms of the survival of patients with lung cancer. Overall, 1106 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (94.3 % with stage IV disease) were included. The outcomes were compared between the patients with (n = 186) and without diabetes (n = 920). The characteristics associated with antidiabetic treatment and proper glycemic control (defined as a mean plasma glucose <130 mg/dL) were examined at diagnosis. The overall survivals (OSs) of the different patient populations were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the influences of the patient and tumor characteristics on survival. The OS for the entire population was 18.3 months (95 % CI 16.1-20.4). There was no difference in the OSs of the diabetic and non-diabetic patients (18.5 vs 16.4 months, p = 0.62). The diabetic patients taking metformin exhibited a superior OS than did those on other antidiabetic treatments (25.6 vs 13.2 months, p = 0.017). Those with proper glycemic control had a better OS than did those without proper glycemic control and the non-diabetics (40.5 vs 13.2 and 18.5 months, respectively, p < 0.001). Both the use of metformin (HR 0.53, p < 0.0001 and HR 0.57, p = 0.017, respectively) and proper glycemic control (HR 0.49, p < 0.0001 and HR 0.40, p = 0.002, respectively) were significant protective factors in all and only diabetic patients, respectively. The diabetic patients with proper glycemic control exhibited a better OS than did those without proper glycemic control and even exhibited a better OS than did the patients without diabetes mellitus. Metformin use was independently associated with a better OS.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies provide conflicting evidence on whether metformin is protective against cancer. When studying time-varying exposure to metformin, covariates such as body mass index (BMI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may act as both confounders and causal pathway variables, and so cannot be handled adequately by standard regression methods. Marginal structural models (MSMs) with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) can correctly adjust for such confounders. Using this approach, the main objective of this study was to estimate the effect of metformin on cancer risk compared with risk in patients with T2DM taking no medication. Patients with incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database of electronic health records derived from primary care in the UK. Patients entered the study at diabetes diagnosis or the first point after this when they had valid HbA1c and BMI measurements, and follow-up was split into 1-month intervals. Logistic regression was used to calculate IPTW; then the effect of metformin on all cancers (including and excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers was estimated in the weighted population. A total of 55 629 T2DM patients were alive and cancer-free at their study entry; 2530 people had incident cancer during a median follow-up time of 2.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.3-5.4 years]. Using the MSM approach, the hazard ratio (HR) for all cancers, comparing treatment with metformin with no glucose-lowering treatment, was 1.02 (0.88-1.18). Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and remained consistent when estimating the treatment effect by length of exposure. We also found no evidence of a protective effect of metformin on individual cancer outcomes. We find no evidence that metformin has a causal association with cancer risk.",

A retrospective cohort study, Clinical Practice Research Datalink, was designed to investigate the association between use of metformin compared with other antidiabetes medications and cancer risk by emulating an intention-to-treat analysis as in a trial. A total of 95,820 participants with type 2 diabetes who started taking metformin and other oral antidiabetes medications within 12 months of their diagnosis (initiators) were followed up for first incident cancer diagnosis without regard to any subsequent changes in pharmacotherapy. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI. A total of 51,484 individuals (54%) were metformin initiators and 18,264 (19%) were sulfonylurea initiators, and 3,805 first incident cancers were diagnosed during a median follow-up time of 5.1 years. Compared with initiators of sulfonylurea, initiators of metformin had a similar incidence of total cancer (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89-1.04) and colorectal (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76-1.13), prostate (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.25), lung (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.68-1.07), or postmenopausal breast (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.82-1.31) cancer or any other cancer. In this large study, individuals with diabetes who used metformin had a similar risk of developing cancer compared with those who used sulfonylureas.",

Type II diabetes has been linked to the development of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), consisting of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previously we have demonstrated lower risk for a subsequent KC in metformin users. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between sulfonylureas use and the development of KC in patients with KC history. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial, which was a randomized double-blind vehicle-control cream originally investigating the effect of 5-fluorouracil on KC development. 932 patients with a history of KC were enrolled (98% male, 99% white, median age of 70 years) and followed for a median duration of 2.8 years. 153 patients were on metformin and 94 on sulfonylureas. We performed a survival analysis with cox regression and controlled for body mass index and known predictors: number of prior BCCs and age (for BCC) and for number of prior SCCs (invasive and in situ), number of actinic keratoses at baseline (for SCC). Sulfonylurea-users com-pared to non-users had a HR of 0.67 (CI: 0.40&ndash;1.56; P=0.49) and 0.94 (CI: 0.63&ndash;1.40; P= 0.77), for SCC and BCC, respectively.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of metformin exposure on mortality, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with diabetes and cirrhosis, controlling for multiple concomitant exposures. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed between January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2016, in the Veterans Health administration. Marginal structural models and propensity-matching approaches were implemented to quantify the treatment effect of metformin in patients with pre-existing diabetes with or without prior metformin exposure. Among 74,984 patients with cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus was present before the diagnosis of cirrhosis in 53.8%, and was diagnosed during follow-up evaluation in 4.8%. Before the diagnosis of cirrhosis, 11,114 patients had active utilization of metformin. In these patients, metformin, statin, and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-2-receptor blocker exposure were associated independently with reduced mortality (metformin hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75); metformin was not associated with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation after adjustment for concomitant statin exposure. For patients with diabetes before a diagnosis of cirrhosis but no prior metformin exposure, metformin similarly was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.35-0.97), but not with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation. Metformin use in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes appears safe and is associated independently with reduced overall, but not liver-related, mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, or decompensation after adjusting for concomitant statin and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-2-receptor blocker exposure.",

      "abstract": "In patients with NAFLD, those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high risk of progression to HCC. However, the determinants of HCC risk in these patients remain unclear. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD and DM diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008. We followed patients from the date of NAFLD diagnosis to HCC, death, or 12/31/2018. We used landmark Cox proportional hazards models to determine the effects of anti-DM medications (metformin, insulin, sulfonylureas) and glycemic control (percent of follow-up time with hemoglobin A1c < 7%) on the risk of HCC while adjusting for demographics and other metabolic traits (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia). We identified 85,963 patients with NAFLD and DM. In total, 524 patients developed HCC during a mean of 10.3 years of follow-up. Most common treatments were metformin monotherapy (19.7%), metformin-sulfonylureas (19.6%), insulin (9.3%), and sulfonylureas monotherapy (13.6%). Compared with no medication, metformin was associated with 20% lower risk of HCC (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98). Insulin had no effect on HCC risk (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85-1.22; p = 0.85). Insulin in combination with other oral medications was associated with a 1.6 to 1.7-fold higher risk of HCC. Adequate glycemic control was associated with a 31% lower risk of HCC (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.78). In this large cohort of patients with NAFLD and DM, use of metformin was associated with a reduced risk of HCC, whereas use of combination therapy was associated with increased risk. Glycemic control can serve as a biomarker for HCC risk stratification in patients with NAFLD and diabetes.",

To delineate the association between metformin use and invasive SCC, SCC in situ (SCCis), and BCC. A population-based case-control study design was employed using all 6880 patients diagnosed in Iceland between 2003-2017 with first-time BCC, SCCis, or invasive SCC, and 69,620 population controls. Multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Metformin was associated with a lower risk of developing BCC (OR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.83), even at low doses. No increased risk of developing SCC was observed. SCCis risk was mildly elevated in the 501-1500 daily dose unit category (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.96). This study was retrospective in nature with the inability to adjust for ultraviolet exposure, Fitzpatrick skin type, and comorbidities. Metformin is associated with decreased risk of BCC development, even at low doses. Metformin might have potential as a chemoprotective agent for patients at high risk of BCC, although this will need confirmation in future studies.",

      "abstract": "No evidence exists as to whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impairs clinical outcome from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with solid tumors. In a large cohort of ICI recipients treated at 21 institutions from June 2014 to June 2020, we studied whether patients on glucose-lowering medications (GLM) for T2DM had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We used targeted transcriptomics in a subset of patients to explore differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients with or without diabetes. A total of 1,395 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 54.7%), melanoma (24.7%), renal cell (15.0%), and other carcinomas (5.6%). After multivariable analysis, patients on GLM (n = 226, 16.2%) displayed an increased risk of death [HR, 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.07-1.56] and disease progression/death (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43) independent of number of GLM received. We matched 92 metformin-exposed patients with 363 controls and 78 patients on other oral GLM or insulin with 299 control patients. Exposure to metformin, but not other GLM, was associated with an increased risk of death (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16-2.03) and disease progression/death (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Patients with T2DM with higher pretreatment glycemia had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.04), while exploratory tumoral transcriptomic profiling in a subset of patients (n = 22) revealed differential regulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways in patients with T2DM. In this study, patients on GLM experienced worse outcomes from immunotherapy, independent of baseline features. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the relative impact of metformin over a preexisting diagnosis of T2DM in influencing poorer outcomes in this population.",

The current study was designed to elucidate the effect of metformin on tumor growth in sporadic VS using volumetric analyses. Retrospective cohort. Tertiary referral center. Patients with sporadic VS who elected initial conservative treatment with at least two serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were included. Metformin use among patients with observed sporadic VS. Tumor growth, defined as an increase in volume of at least 20% from the initial MRI. A total of 361 patients were evaluated. Thirty-four patients (9%) had a diagnosis of diabetes at baseline. Nineteen patients (5%) were taking metformin at the time of the initial MRI. Metformin use was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of volumetric tumor growth in a univariable analysis in all patients undergoing observation for VS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.40-1.42; p = 0.38) or within the diabetic subset (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.34-1.83; p = 0.58). Additionally, diabetes status, insulin dependence, hemoglobin A1c value, and metformin dose were not significantly associated with volumetric tumor growth. Despite promising initial results in several previous studies, our data suggest that metformin use does not significantly reduce the risk of volumetric tumor growth in sporadic VS.",

In this study, we assessed the association between metformin use and overall survival in glioblastoma patients. We retrospectively studied 241 patients who underwent surgery at diagnosis of glioblastoma between 2014 and 2018. Metformin was used for pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus or in the prevention or management of glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank p test were used for univariate analysis. Cox-proportional hazards model was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios for multivariate analysis. Metformin use was associated with longer survival in patients with tumors that had a methylated O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) promoter (484 days 95% CI: 56-911 vs. 394 days 95% CI: 249-538, Log-Rank test: 6.5, p = 0.01). Cox regression analysis shows that metformin associates with lower risk of death at 2 years in patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated MGMT promoter (aHR = 0.497, 95% CI 0.26-0.93, p = 0.028). Our findings suggest a survival benefit with metformin use in patients with glioblastomas having methylation of the MGMT promoter.",

Patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed during 1999-2005 and newly treated with metformin (n=287971, \"ever users of metformin\") or other antidiabetic drugs (n=16217, \"never users of metformin\") were followed until December 31, 2011. The effect of metformin (for ever versus never users, and for tertiles of cumulative duration of therapy) was estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score. Results showed that the respective numbers of incident gastric cancer in ever and never users were 759 (0.26%) and 89 (0.55%), with respective incidences of 55.26 and 122.53 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 0.448 (0.359-0.558) suggested a significantly lower risk among ever users. In tertile analyses, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the first (＜21.47 months), second (21.47-45.97 months) and third (＞45.97 months) tertile of cumulative duration was 0.973 (0.773-1.224), 0.422 (0.331-0.537) and 0.120 (0.090-0.161), respectively, while compared to never users. In conclusion, metformin significantly reduces gastric cancer risk, especially when the cumulative duration is more than approximately 2 years.",

Data are not available in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. The aim of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the potential impact in terms of clinical outcome of the common non-cancer medications. All consecutive patients with CCAs were retrospectively identified from 7 Italian medical institutions. We investigated the role of intake of vitamin D, aspirin, metformin, statins, and diuretics. A total of 537 patients with CCAs were identified; 197 patients undergoing surgery were evaluated for disease-free survival (DFS), and 509 patients with an advanced stage were evaluated for overall survival (OS). A longer DFS was found in patients with intake of vitamin D versus never users (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02). In an advanced stage an association with OS was found in patients with intake of metformin versus never users (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.93, p = 0.0162), and in patients who have started taking metformin after chemotherapy versus before chemotherapy and never users (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.73, p = 0.0016). Our results highlighted that vitamin D intake improves DFS in patients undergoing surgery. Metformin intake after starting chemotherapy can improve the clinical outcome in advanced disease. These results could open up new therapeutic strategies in cholangiocarcinoma patients. We are planning to undertake a prospective study to validate these data.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is frequently prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes. Its primarily regulates hepatic and colonic glucose metabolism, but recent studies have suggested an anti-inflammatory effect, especially in colitis. It has been suggested that metformin may enhance immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) efficacy for cancer treatment. Our study aims to explore the impact of metformin on ICI efficacy and the risk for colitis. This was a single center, retrospective analysis of consecutive patients at a tertiary cancer center who received ICI between 01/2010-12/2022 and developed immune-mediated colitis (IMC). Patients were screened for colitis based on stool tests, then divided into two groups depending on metformin use prior to colitis onset. We collected data on demographic and colitis clinical information including treatments, and outcomes. A total of 953 patients were included. The incidence of IMC was higher among metformin users (7.6 %) than non-metformin users (4.9 %; p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in colitis features and outcomes, except for longer hospital stay among metformin users (8 days vs 6 for non-metformin users; p = 0.03). Metformin use was associated with shorter overall survival vs non-metformin users among patients with IMC (p = 0.03). Our study is among the first to explore the impact of metformin on IMC and overall survival. We found that metformin use may be associated with higher risk of IMC. We also found an association between metformin use and shorter overall survival among patients who developed IMC. Larger studies with risk-stratified analysis are needed to validate our findings.",

      "abstract": "Conflicting data exists on the influence of metformin on prostate cancer. We investigated the importance of metformin in patients treated with radiotherapy or brachytherapy. All patients from a large institutionalized database, treated for primary localized prostate cancer with either brachytherapy or external-beam radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy were identified. Groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models. Multivariate analysis was adjusted for CAPRA-Score, type of treatment and age. A total of 2441 patients with complete data was identified. Among the 382 patients (16% of total) were diabetic. Two-hundred and eighty-one of the 382 diabetics (74%) were treated with metformin and 101 were treated with other anti-diabetic medication. Median follow up was 48 months (interquartile range [IQR] 24-84). Two-hundred eighteen patients (9%) died and 150 (6%) experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR). On unadjusted univariate analysis for BCR-free survival, metformin users showed a 50% reduction in BCR compared to non-metformin users. The results remained significant on multivariate analysis comparing diabetic metformin users to non-metformin users (diabetics and non-diabetics combined) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5-0.6, p = 0.03-0.04) but lost its significance when adjusting for cancer aggressiveness. On multivariate analysis, diabetics had worse overall survival (OS) than non-diabetics (HR 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.06, p = 0.01), but diabetics on metformin fared better than diabetics not taking metformin (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26-0.86, p = 0.01). Metformin use in this analysis appears to be associated with better BCR and OS. Larger datasets and prospective trials are warranted to validate these results.",

      "abstract": "Oesophageal cancer comprises 2 different histological variants: oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). While there are multiple therapeutic options for both types, patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer still suffer from poor prognosis. The study aimed to examine the association between the risk of oesophageal cancer and medications and to estimate the chemopreventive effects of commonly used drugs. A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 9 hospital databases of hospitalized patients between 2014 and 2019. The primary outcomes were ESCC and EAC. The association of oesophageal cancer with drug use and clinical factors was evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index scores, and smoking with/without gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.48, p < 0.0001), aspirin (aOR 0.32, p < 0.0001), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (COX2I) (aOR 0.70, p = 0.0005), steroid (aOR 0.19, p < 0.0001), statin (aOR 0.43, p < 0.0001), and metformin (aOR 0.42, p < 0.0001) was associated with a lower risk of ESCC than that in non-use. The use of aspirin (aOR 0.33, p = 0.0006) and steroids (aOR 0.54, p = 0.022) was associated with a lower risk of EAC than that in non-use. COX2Is, statins, metformin, and PPIs could help in prevention of ESCC, and aspirin and steroids may be chemopreventive for both types of oesophageal cancer.",

Literature in the general diabetic population has identified possible antineoplastic properties of metformin. This retrospective study aims to determine if metformin results in a malignancy risk reduction in a cohort of diabetic kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients. The population included transplant recipients without use of metformin at any time point (DMO arm, n = 147) and those with use of metformin (DMM arm, n = 172); the two arms were matched based on organ type and transplant date prior to application of exclusion criteria. Recipients with prior malignancy, malignancy before diabetes diagnosis, and metformin duration <30 days were excluded. The primary endpoint of malignancy first occurrence post-transplant was not found to be statistically significant at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years. In the subgroup of heart transplant recipients, there was a significant reduction in malignancy at 15 years post-transplant. Older age and Caucasian race were identified as significant risk factors for malignancy, while never smoker was a protective factor. Metformin use in this solid organ transplant cohort was not found to significantly reduce malignancy risk compared to use of other anti-diabetic agents.",

      "abstract": "Malignant neoplasms are the leading cause of death in Korea. We aimed to examine if metformin use in cancer survivors reduces all-cause mortality. This study was retrospectively designed based on data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort (HEALS) between 2002 and 2015. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test was performed to estimate the survival function according to metformin usage (3721 metformin non-users with diabetes, 5580 metformin users with diabetes, and 24,483 non-diabetic individuals). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.The median follow-up duration was 4.2 years. The HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality of metformin users and the non-diabetic group were 0.762 (0.683-0.850) and 1.055 (0.966-1.152) in men and 0.805 (0.649-0.999), and 1.049 (0.873-1.260) in women, respectively, compared with metformin non-users among diabetic cancer survivors, in a fully adjusted model. After stratifying metformin users into pre- and post-diagnosis of cancers, adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of pre- and post-diagnosis metformin users for all-cause mortality were 0.948 (0.839-1.071) and 0.530 (0.452-0.621) in men and 1.163 (0.921-1.469) and 0.439 (0.323-0.596) in women, respectively.Metformin use in cancer survivors with diabetes reduced overall mortality rates. In particular, metformin use after cancer diagnosis, not before cancer diagnosis, was inversely associated with overall mortality.Active treatment with metformin for diabetic cancer survivors after cancer diagnosis can improve their survival rates.",

We assembled a retrospective cohort data of 20 577 patients who were free of cancer and on metformin-sulfonylurea dual therapy, and whose drug treatments were intensified with DPP4i (n=9957), insulin (n=7760), or thiazolidinediones (n=2860) from January 2006 to December 2017. Propensity-score weighting was used to balance out baseline covariates across the three groups. HRs for any types of cancer, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Over a mean follow-up period of 34 months with 58 539 person-years, cumulative incidences of cancer, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were 0.028, 0.009, and 0.072, respectively. Patients intensified with insulin had the highest incidence of all-cause mortality (incidence rate=3.22/100 person-years) and the insulin itself posed the greatest risk (HR 2.46, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.70, p<0.001; 2.44, 95% CI 2.23 to 2.67) compared with thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, respectively. Comparing between thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, thiazolidinediones was associated with higher risk of cancer (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.63) but not cancer mortality (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.58) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11). Insulin was associated with the greatest risk of cancer mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.71; 1.65, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.07) compared with thiazolidinediones and DPP4i, respectively. For patients with T2DM on metformin-sulfonylurea dual therapy, the addition of DPP4i was the third-line medication least likely to be associated with cancer mortality and cancer effect among three options, and posed no increased risk for all-cause mortality when compared with thiazolidinediones.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) and the consecutively daily use of antidiabetic medication are characterized by a frequent prevalence worldwide and were shown to impact the initiation and progression of malignant diseases. While these effects were observed in a variety of malignancies, comprehensive data about the role of DM2 and antidiabetic drugs in the outcome of head and neck melanoma (HNM) patients are missing. This retrospective population-based cohort study included 382 HNM patients from Eastern Bavaria having received tumor resection to negative margins between 2010 and 2017. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was evaluated with regard to DM2 and routine metformin intake. Statistical analysis was performed by uni- and multivariate analyses. The median follow-up time was 5.6 years. DM2 was diagnosed in 68 patients (17.8%), routine metformin intake was found in 39 cases (10.2%). The univariate survival analysis revealed impaired 5-year RFS in HNM patients with DM2 compared to non-diabetic controls (<i>p</i> = 0.016; 64.0% and 74.5%, respectively). The multivariate Cox regression substantiated this effect (HR = 1.980, 95% CI = 1.108-3.538, <i>p</i> = 0.021). In detail, the cumulative locoregional recurrence rate displayed the most far-reaching negative effect on the RFS of diabetic HNM patients (HR = 4.173, 95% CI = 1.628-10.697, <i>p</i> = 0.003). For metformin intake, a profound positive effect on the RFS in multivariate statistics was observed, both in the complete cohort (HR = 0.396, 95% CI = 0.177-0.884, <i>p</i> = 0.024) as well as in the cohort of diabetic HNM patients (HR = 0.352, 95% CI = 0.135-0.913, <i>p</i> = 0.032). This study emphasizes that DM2 is a relevant comorbid condition in HNM patients, impairing patient survival. Metformin intake was associated with a favorable outcome in HNM patients, providing possible therapeutic implications for future adjuvant treatment regimes.",

From Taiwan's population-based National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) we identified 12,512 patients with CRC and type II diabetes who underwent curative surgery between 2000 and 2012. Of these, 6222 patients were included in a matched cohort. Using Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates we examined the impact of metformin on survival. Average duration of follow-up was 49 and 54 months for metformin users and non-users, respectively. Cox proportional hazard model showed that metformin was associated with 5-year overall survival benefit (Hazard ratio, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.20-0.26]) and inverse association with risk of liver metastasis (Hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68-0.93]). Metformin was associated with a survival benefit in diabetic patients with CRC following surgery, and an inverse association with risk of liver metastases suggesting a potential anti-tumorigenic effect.",

We have analyzed the role of various antidiabetic drugs on HCC in a nested case-control study using the healthcare utilization databases of the Lombardy Region in Italy. This included 190 diabetic subjects with a hospital discharge reporting a diagnosis of malignant HCC and 3772 diabetic control subjects matched to each case on sex, age, date at cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Increased risks of HCC were found for use of insulin (odds ratio [OR] = 3.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-5.51), sulfonylureas (OR = 1.39, 95%CI 0.98-1.99), and repaglinide (OR = 2.12, 95%CI 1.38-3.26), while a reduced risk was found for use of metformin (OR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.79). The risk of HCC increased with increasing duration of insulin use (OR = 2.52 for <1 year, 5.41 for 1-2 years, and 6.01 for ≥2 years; p for trend < 0.001), while no clear pattern with duration was observed for sulfonylureas, repaglinide, and metformin. Our study supports the evidence that patients with diabetes using metformin, and possibly other antidiabetic drugs that increase insulin sensibility, have a reduced risk of HCC, while those using insulin or drugs that increase circulating insulin, such as insulin secretagogues, have an increased risk. Whether these associations are causal, or influenced by different severity of diabetes and/or possible residual bias or misclassification, is still open to discussion.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical studies have shown anticancer activities of metformin in gastric cancer and a recent epidemiological study showed a decrease in recurrence and mortality of gastric cancer in metformin users. This study aimed to assess the impact of metformin on gastric cancer survival in diabetic patients at a Belgian population level. We conducted an observational, population-based study by linking data of the Belgian Cancer Registry with medical claims data coming from the health insurance companies for patients diagnosed with stage I to III gastric adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2012. Information on gastric cancer-specific deaths was retrieved from mortality records collected by regional governments. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific mortality (CSS). In our population of 371 patients, a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in metformin users (adjusted HR = 0.73, 95% CI: [0.52; 1.01], p = 0.06) but not for cancer specific mortality (adjusted HR = 0.86, 95% CI: [0.56; 1.33], p = 0.50). Pre-diagnosis exposure to metformin was associated with a significant improvement in OS (adjusted HR = 0.75, 95% CI: [0.57; 0.98], p = 0.04) that was not significant for CSS (adjusted HR = 0.89, 95% CI: [0.62; 1.28], p = 0.52). Moreover, no dose-response relationship between metformin use and either all-cause or cancer-specific mortality was observed. In the first population based study of metformin use in gastric cancer adenocarcinoma patients with previous diabetes, our findings suggest that metformin use might improve overall mortality. However, no such association was found for cancer-specific survival. Additional studies in other populations are required.",

In this study, we sought to determine the association between metformin administration and TACE outcomes for single nodular HCC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The retrospective cohort analysis included 164 T2DM patients with single nodular HCC who underwent TACE as an initial treatment, and 91 were exposed to metformin before and after TACE. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to balance covariates. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of tumor response after TACE, and Cox regression analysis assessed independent predictors of local tumor recurrence (LTR) in patients with complete response after TACE. Metformin use was associated with significantly higher objective response rate (ORR) in the overall and PS-matched cohort (79.1% vs. 60.3 and 78.7% vs. 57.5%; p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that metformin use was an independent predictor of ORR in all and PS-matched patients (odds ratio = 2.65 and 3.06; p = 0.016 and 0.034, respectively). Cox regression analysis showed metformin administration was an independent predictor for lower LTR in all and PS-matched patients (hazard ratio = 0.28 and 0.27; p = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Metformin administration is associated with better initial response and lower local recurrence after TACE for single nodular HCC in T2DM.",

Metformin, one of the most commonly used anti-diabetic drugs worldwide, has also been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity. We therefore investigated the association between metformin therapy and malignancy after HTx. The study population comprised 237 patients who underwent HTx between 1991 and 2016 and were prospectively followed-up. Clinical data were recorded on prospectively designed forms. The primary outcome was any cancer recorded during 15 years of follow-up. Treatment with metformin and the development of DM after HTx were assessed as time-dependent factors in the analyses. Of the 237 study patients, 85 (36%) had diabetes. Of the DM patients, 48 (56%) were treated with metformin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that, at 15 years after HTx, malignancy rate was 4% for DM patients treated with metformin, 62% for those who did not receive metformin and 27% for non-DM patients (log-rank test, p < 0.0001). Consistently, multivariate analysis showed that for DM patients, metformin therapy was independently associated with a significant 90% reduction (hazard ratio = 0.10; 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.40; p = 0.001) in the risk of the development of a malignancy. DM patients who were treated with metformin had a markedly lower risk (65%; p = 0.001) for the development of a malignancy or death after HTx as compared with non-DM patients. Our findings suggest that metformin therapy is independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of malignancy after HTx.",

This study examined whether metformin was associated with reduced CRC risk, both overall and stratified by anatomic site, in a large sample of persons with diabetes who underwent colonoscopy. We performed a case-control study of US Veterans with prevalent diabetes who underwent colonoscopy between 1999 and 2014 using Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health record data. Cases were defined by presence of CRC at colonoscopy, while controls had normal colonoscopy. The primary exposure was metformin use at time of colonoscopy (yes/no). Association of metformin exposure with CRC (further stratified by proximal, distal, or rectal subsite) was examined using multivariable and multinomial logistic regression and summarized by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 6,650 CRC patients and 454,507 normal colonoscopy patients. CRC cases were older and had lower metformin exposure. Metformin was associated with 8% relative reduction in CRC odds (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.96). By subsite, metformin was associated with a 14% statistically significant reduced rectal cancer odds (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.94) but no reduced distal or proximal cancer odds. Metformin was associated with reduced CRC odds-particularly rectal cancer-in a large sample of persons with diabetes undergoing colonoscopy.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical data suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors may promote metastatic progression of preexisting cancer via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation. We aimed to investigate the association between different glucose-lowering treatments, including DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin, both with potential NRF2 modulating effects, and new-onset metastatic cancer among type 2 diabetes patients with comorbid incident cancer. This population-based cohort study included 223,530 diabetic patients newly diagnosed with primary cancer during 2009-2011 in Korea. The patients were categorized into five study cohorts in accordance with treatment modalities during the follow-up until the end of 2016: no-antidiabetic drugs (no-AD), metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin treatment. After propensity score (PS) matching in a 1:1 ratio against the no-AD group, 18,805 patients in metformin, 1,865 in DPP-4 inhibitors, 31,074 in metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and 1,895 patients in insulin groups were identified for cohort entry and analyzed against the corresponding number of no-AD patients in each PS-matched comparison pair. Metastatic risk was lower with metformin plus or minus DPP-4 inhibitors (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90 and 0.87, 0.80-0.95, respectively), not significantly associated with DPP-4 inhibitors (0.99, 0.77-1.29) except after thyroid cancer (3.89, 1.01-9.64), and higher with insulin therapy (1.81, 1.46-2.24) compared to no-AD use for all cancers combined. In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitor therapy was not associated with significant risk of cancer metastasis relative to no-AD therapy, irrespective of patient age and sex, except after thyroid cancer, while metastatic risk was decreased with metformin treatment among type 2 diabetes patients with preexisting cancer.",

We performed a retrospective review of 3217 patients, from 1998 to 2013, subdivided into 5 subgroups: (I) no T2DM; (II) T2DM receiving oral antihyperglycemic agent that contains metformin, no insulin; (III) T2DM receiving nonmetformin oral agent alone, no insulin; (IV) T2DM receiving any insulin; and (V) T2DM not receiving medication. Outcome measures were overall survival, freedom from biochemical failure (BF), freedom from distant metastasis, cancer-specific survival, and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank tests, Fine and Gray competing risk regression (to adjust for patient and lifestyle factors), Cox models, and subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) were used. Of the 3217 patients, 1295 (40%) were low-risk, 1192 (37%) were intermediate-risk, and 652 (20%) were high risk. The group I to V distribution was 81%, 8%, 5%, 3%, and 4%. The median dose was 78 Gy, and the median follow-up time was 50 (range, 1-190) months. Group V had increased mortality (sHR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-1.54), BF (sHR, 2.14; 0.88-1.83), and cause-specific mortality (sHR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.31-11). Acute toxicities were higher in group IV versus group I (genitourinary: 38% vs. 26%; P = .01; gastrointestinal: 21% vs. 5%; P = 001). Late toxicities were higher in groups IV and V versus group I (12%-14% vs. 2%-6%; P < .01). Men with T2DM not receiving medication and men with T2DM receiving insulin had worse outcomes and toxicities compared to other patients.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between metformin use and prostate cancer risk remains controversial. Genetic variation in metformin metabolism pathways appears to modify metformin glycemic control and the protective association with some cancers. However, no studies to date have examined this pharmacogenetic interaction and prostate cancer chemoprevention. Clinical data and germline DNA were collected from our prostate biopsy database between 1996 and 2014. In addition to a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in metformin metabolism were included on a custom SNP array. Associations between metformin use and risk of high-grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) and overall prostate cancer were explored using a case-control design. Interaction between the candidate/GWAS SNPs and the metformin-cancer association was explored using a case-only design. Among 3481 men, 132 (4%) were taking metformin at diagnosis. Metformin users were older, more likely non-Caucasian, and had higher body mass index, Gleason score, and number of positive cores. Overall, 2061 (59%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 922 (45%) were high-grade. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, metformin use was associated with higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.02) and overall prostate cancer (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.03). None of the 27 candidate SNPs in metformin metabolic pathways had significant interaction with the metformin-cancer association. Among the GWAS SNPs, one SNP (rs149137006) had genome-wide significant interaction with metformin for high-grade prostate cancer, and another, rs115071742, for overall prostate cancer. They were intronic and intergenic SNPs, respectively, with largely uncharacterized roles in prostate cancer chemoprevention. In our cohort, metformin use was associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. While SNPs involved in metformin metabolism did not have modifying effects on the association with disease risk, one intronic and one intergenic SNP from the GWAS study did, and these require further study.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Epidemiologic data from several populations suggest that metformin may decrease cancer risk and mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Although type II DM and CRC are major health problems in the Middle East, no investigations have been performed to test the effect metformin has on the outcome of patients with type II DM and CRC who are also treated with metformin. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,902 patients diagnosed with CRC at King Hussein Cancer Center between January 2004 and December 2012, and identified 349 patients (18%) with type II DM; we censored the data of 28 patients because their antidiabetic medications were unknown. We then categorized these 321 patients into two groups: 192 patients treated with metformin (group A) and 129 patients treated with other antidiabetic medications (group B). Results Group A patients had significantly longer overall survival (89 months; 95% CI, 66 to 112 months) and progression-free survival (47 months; 95% CI, 15 to 79 months) than group B patients (overall survival: 36 months; 95% CI, 24 to 48 months; P ≤ .001; progression-free survival: 21 months; 95% CI, 13 to 29 months; P = .016). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, aspirin use, anticholesterol treatment, and CRC stage, group A patients had a 40% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.4% to 0.85%; P = .005). Conclusion Our results support findings from other populations that patients with diabetes and CRC who are also treated with metformin have better outcomes than those treated with other antidiabetic medications.",

This study evaluates the effect of metformin on tumor response after Y-90 RS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A retrospective analysis of patients with HCC who underwent Y-90 RS between 2014-2018 was performed. Comparisons were made between all patients taking and not taking metformin, and diabetic patients taking and not taking metformin. Tumor response was analyzed with logistic regression to compare absolute and percent change in total tumor diameter (TTD) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank analysis. A total of 106 patients underwent 112 Y-90 RS, of which 40 were diabetic (38.8%) and 19 (18.4%) were on metformin. At baseline, the two groups of patients on metformin and not on metformin had no significant difference in age, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, ALBI grade, total tumor diameter, and size of dominant tumor. The only significant baseline difference was ECOG status. Uni- and multivariate analysis demonstrated a larger reduction in TTD and objective response by mRECIST criteria for patients undergoing Y-90 RS on metformin compared to those not on metformin. OS was similar between patients taking and not taking metformin (p = 0.912). Metformin may be associated with increased tumor response after Y-90 RS in patients with HCC. III, Retrospective Study.",

      "abstract": "Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.",

      "abstract": "Prior research suggests metformin has anti-cancer effects, yet data are limited. We examined the association between diabetes treatment (metformin versus sulfonylurea) and risk of incident diabetes-related and non- diabetes-related cancers in US veterans. This retrospective cohort study included US veterans, without cancer, aged ≥ 55 years, who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas for diabetes between 2001 to 2012. Cox proportional hazards models, with propensity score-matched inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were constructed. A total of 88,713 veterans (mean age 68.6 ± 7.8 years; 97.7% male; 84.1% White, 12.6% Black, 3.3% other race) were followed for 4.2 ± 3.0 years. Among metformin users (n = 60,476), there were 858 incident diabetes-related cancers (crude incidence rate [IR; per 1,000 person-years] = 3.4) and 3,533 non-diabetes-related cancers (IR = 14.1). Among sulfonylurea users (n = 28,237), there were 675 incident diabetes-related cancers (IR = 5.5) and 2,316 non-diabetes-related cancers (IR = 18.9). After IPTW adjustment, metformin use was associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes-related cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, 95% CI 0.58-0.75) compared to sulfonylurea use. There was no association between treatment group (metformin versus sulfonylurea) and non-diabetes-related cancer (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.02). Of diabetes-related cancers, metformin users had lower incidence of liver (HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.28-0.53), colorectal (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.92), and esophageal cancers (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.81). Among US veterans, metformin users had lower incidence of diabetes-related cancer, particularly liver, colorectal, and esophageal cancers, as compared to sulfonylurea users. Use of metformin was not associated with non-diabetes-related cancer. Further studies are needed to understand how metformin use impacts cancer incidence in different patient populations.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of metformin on cancer incidence in a consecutive series of insulin-treated patients. A nested case-control study was performed in a cohort of 1,340 patients by sampling, for each case subject, age-, sex-, and BMI-matched control subjects from the same cohort. During a median follow-up of 75.9 months, 112 case patients who developed incident cancer and were compared with 370 control subjects. A significantly lower proportion of case subjects were exposed to metformin and sulfonylureas. After adjustment for comorbidity, glargine, and total insulin doses, exposure to metformin, but not to sulfonylureas, was associated with reduced incidence of cancer (odds ratio 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.85], P = 0.014 and 0.75 [0.39-1.45], P = 0.40, respectively). The reduction of cancer risk could be a further relevant reason for maintaining use of metformin in insulin-treated patients.",

The use of antidiabetic medication (ADM) may play an important role in the cancer development. The relationship between oral ADM and cancer incidence has not been investigated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in mainland China yet. A community-based diabetes cohort was extracted from the Shanghai Community Diabetes Management System database, which is a patient registry from general practices. The cohort included 2353 newly onset type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from 2006 to 2010 aged 35 years or more. Patients were grouped into nonusers of antidiabetic medication (n = 722), metformin monotherapy (n = 374), sulfonylurea monotherapy (n = 653), metformin and sulfonylurea combination therapy (n = 302), and other medication therapies (n = 302) on the basis of initial treatment type at registry entry. Cancer incidence was identified from the Shanghai Cancer Registry Organization. Comparisons between monotherapy and nonuser of medication were conducted using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 94 cancer cases were identified during 5 years median follow-up. Compared with nonusers, sulfonylurea monotherapy was associated with significantly lower risk of cancer [adjusted HR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.29-0.85)] whereas risk was 49% lower with metformin monotherapy [adjusted HR = 0.51 (95% CI 0.27-0.99)]. The real-world evidence suggested that the use of metformin or sulfonylurea was associated with lower risk of cancer incidence in a cohort of newly onset type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",

      "abstract": "Most studies that have evaluated the association between anti-diabetic medication and cancer risk have suffered from methodological drawbacks. To avoid time-related biases, we evaluated the effect of treatment duration on the cancer risk among naive users of anti-diabetic medication as compared to non-users. In addition, we addressed the influence of common risk factors such as smoking and BMI. The study population comprised 23,394 participants of FINRISK surveys. Data on cancer and anti-diabetic medication were linked with the study cohorts. We applied Lexis tabulation to the data and analyzed split records by using Poisson regression. Changes in cancer incidence in relation to treatment duration were examined by modeling the rate ratio (RR). After a median follow-up of 9 years, 53 cancer cases among users of anti-diabetic medication and 1,028 among non-users were diagnosed. No significant difference in cancer risk between users and non-users was observed after adjustment. The RR for all medication regardless of its duration was 1.01 [95% CI 0.75-1.33], and 1.37 [0.94-1.94] for period of 1-4 years. The results were similar for metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin. This study demonstrates that evaluation of the variation in cancer risk in relation to treatment duration is of particular importance for enhancing the accuracy of conclusions on the link between exposure to anti-diabetic medication and cancer risk.",

Data from 4,314 men aged 55-70 years from a population-based PSA-screening trial (ERSPC Aarau) were analyzed. Information on metformin exposure was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. Serum PSA threshold at ≥3 ng/ml triggered prostate biopsy. Data on PCa incidence and mortality were obtained through registry linkages. Median follow-up time was 7.6 years. Mean age at baseline was 65.5 years (±SD 4.4). In all, n = 150 (3.5 %) men used metformin [metf+]. Mean baseline PSA levels were comparable between both groups ([metf+] 1.6 ng/ml ± 2.4 vs. [metf-] 1.8ug/l ± 2.2, p = 0.4) while f/t-ratio was slightly higher in metformin users ([metf+] 30.7 % ± 10.9 vs. [metf-] 27.3 % ± 10.9, p = 0.01). Overall, n = 372 (8.6 %) PCa cases were detected. Neither cumulative PCa incidence (n = 11; 7.3 % [metf+] vs. n = 361 8.7 % [metf-]; p = 0.5) nor d`Amico risk groups were significantly different between both groups. One man in each group (metf+ 0.7 % and metf- 0.02 %) died from PCa (p < 0.0001), respectively. All-cause mortality was significantly higher among met + compared to met- (adjusted OR 2.50, 95 %CI 1.59-3.82; p = 0.0001). No significant differences in PSA levels or PCa incidence and grade were observed. The slightly higher f/t-ratio did not result in lower PCa detection rate. Metformin users were at significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality. The relatively small number of men on metformin is a main limitation of the study.",

Metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic drug, has been shown to be protective against different types of cancers; however, its role in esophageal cancer is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether the use of metformin modifies the risk of development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett esophagus. Patients with diagnoses of Barrett esophagus and esophageal cancer were identified during a 20-year period. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The outcome variable was esophageal adenocarcinoma. Univariate analysis was performed using two-sample t tests for continuous variables or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was then performed using the significant variables. A total of 583 patients were identified with the diagnosis of Barrett esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma from 1992 to 2012. Of these, 115 had esophageal adenocarcinoma and 468 had Barrett esophagus. Age, smoking, and diabetes mellitus were found to be significant risk factors for the development of esophageal cancer with the following results: age (P < 0.001), smoking (P = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.007). Statin use was protective against the development of cancer with P = 0.001. Metformin use was neither associated with an increased nor a decreased risk of esophageal cancer. The three independent variables that predicted progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma in our study were older age, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Statin use showed protective effect against development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Metformin use did not demonstrate any statistically significant protective effect.",

      "abstract": "Meta-analyses have reported a decrease in overall cancer incidence of approximately 10% to 40% with metformin use among individuals with diabetes. Lifestyle change could potentially reduce cancer incidence. The objective was to determine whether metformin or intensive lifestyle (ILS) intervention reduces the risk of cancer among adults at high risk of diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (1996-2001) randomized 3,234 participants to ILS, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or blinded placebo. During follow-up through the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, all participants were offered a modified lifestyle intervention, and metformin continued in an open-label metformin group. Participants reported cancer cases annually. Medical records were adjudicated for all reported events. The primary endpoint was total cancer incidence, comparing metformin versus placebo, with ILS versus placebo as a secondary objective. After a median follow-up of 21 years, 546 participants (173 metformin, 182 ILS, and 191 placebo) were diagnosed with a first incident cancer. Incidence rates of cancer were 9.8, 10.5, and 10.8 per 1,000 person-years in metformin, ILS, and placebo, respectively, with a HR of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.10) for metformin compared with placebo and 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.18) for ILS compared with placebo. There were no differences between any treatment groups for obesity-related cancer or in sex-specific analyses. Neither assignment to metformin nor ILS reduced cancer incidence among adults at high risk of diabetes. These results may be impacted by increased nonstudy metformin usage over time due to the development of diabetes and reduced intensity of the ILS intervention over time. This study examines both metformin and ILS intervention as primary cancer prevention interventions in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",

We studied the incidence of lung cancer in patients who received metformin therapy. This study was retrospectively designed and based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort to determine whether metformin reduces lung cancer risk in the diabetic population. At baseline, all participants were 40 to 69 years old and were categorized into 3 groups: metformin nonrecipients with DM, metformin recipients with DM, and the nondiabetic group. A total of 336,168 individuals were included in the final analysis (314,291 nondiabetic individuals, 8806 metformin recipients, and 13,071 metformin nonrecipients). The study median follow-up period was 12.86 years. The estimated cumulative lung cancer incidence of metformin nonrecipients, metformin recipients, and the nondiabetic group was 1.80%, 1.97%, and 1.24% in men and 1.87%, 0.61%, and 0.41% in women, respectively (P < .05). Compared to metformin nonrecipients, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for lung cancer incidence of metformin recipients and the nondiabetic group were 1.287 (0.979-1.691) and 0.835 (0.684-1.019) in men and 0.664 (0.374-1.177) and 0.553 (0.359-0.890) in women, respectively. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were statistically significant in male ever smokers (0.784 [0.627-0.979]) and female nonsmokers (0.498 [0.320-0.774]) after stratification according to smoking status. Metformin therapy did not reduce lung cancer incidence in the diabetic population. However, individuals without DM were at a lower risk of lung cancer, especially in male ever smokers and female nonsmokers.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a prevalent malignancy that is a major health problem for women worldwide. The cancer-preventive properties of metformin are well-known, but insufficient data have been reported regarding its relationship to cervical cancer. Therefore, in a nationwide population-based study, we investigated the association between metformin use and cervical cancer incidence in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This retrospective cohort study used the Korean National Health Insurance claims database. Individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between January 2005 and December 2009 were included. The occurrence of cervical cancer was explored by matching for age, economic status, region of residence, and use of anti-diabetic medication. In total, 66,013 metformin users and 64,756 non-users were analyzed. Cervical cancer occurred in 219 metformin users (0.33%) and 274 metformin non-users (0.42%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.783; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.655 to 0.036; P=0.007). Moreover, cervical cancer risk was considerably reduced in those treated with a high dose (>1,200,000 mg) or for an extended period (≥2,000 days) compared to non-users (HR, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.093 to 0.243; P<0.001; and HR, 0.141; 95% CI, 0.077 to 0.258; P<0.001). The incidence was also significantly lower in metformin users among those over 50 years old (HR, 0.791; 95% CI, 0.650 to 0.961; P<0.001). Metformin use in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes was associated with a lower risk of cervical cancer in Korea. Furthermore, a significant association was found between the use of metformin and cervical cancer in a dose- and duration-dependent manner and among those over 50 years old.",

      "abstract": "Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) often causes chronic inflammation of the liver with an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV-infected individuals may also have an increased incidence of nonliver cancers. Taking statin or metformin may decrease inflammation and infiltration, which may, as a result, reduce the risk of liver cancer or other major cancers in patients with HBV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that statin and metformin could reduce the incidence of liver cancer (HCC) or nonliver cancers in patients with HBV.Using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 to 2008, this cohort study comprised patients with a recorded diagnosis of HBV (N = 71,847) between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008. Each patient was followed-up until the end of 2008. The occurrence of HCC or a nonliver cancer was evaluated in patients who either were or were not taking statin or metformin. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to evaluate the cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors.In total, 71,824 HBV-infected patients comprised the study cohort. Our study showed that either metformin or statin use was associated with a reduction in the incidence of cancer. This was most prominent in patients taking both statin and metformin. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for patients using only statin were 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.57) for all cancers, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.23-0.35) for liver cancer, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.57-0.70) for nonliver cancers. Patients taking only metformin had risk-adjusted HRs of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75-0.90) for all cancers, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.14) for liver cancer, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.84) for nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of statin use for chemoprevention was observed for all cancers, including both liver cancer and nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of metformin was also seen in liver cancer and nonliver cancers without stratification into different cumulative daily doses of statin use.This population-based cohort study investigated the protective effect of statin and metformin against cancer events in patients with HBV infection. Our study demonstrated that either statin or metformin served as independent chemopreventive agents with a dose-response effect in reducing the incidence of cancer with a dose-response effect of the agents and an additive or synergistic effect of combining statin and metformin use in reducing the incidence of many cancers.",

This is a retrospective cohort analysis using the National Health Insurance database of Taiwan. Female patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and without endometrial cancer in 1998-2002 were followed to end of 2009 (n=478,921). Among them, 285,916 were never-users and 193,005 were ever-users of metformin. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate endometrial cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios by Cox regression for ever-users, never-users, and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in various subgroups. During follow-up, 728 metformin ever-users and 2157 never-users developed endometrial cancer, representing an incidence of 60.00 and 121.69 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for ever- versus never-users after adjustment for propensity score (PS) was 0.675 (0.614-0.742). The PS-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second, and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 1.089 (0.966-1.228), 0.707 (0.616-0.812) and 0.313 (0.262-0.374), respectively (P-trend<0.0001); and 1.062 (0.942-1.197), 0.620 (0.538-0.715) and 0.376 (0.317-0.447), respectively (P-trend<0.0001), for cumulative dose of metformin. The dose-response relationship was demonstrated in various models and an overall reduced risk was consistently supported by sensitivity analyses. The use of metformin in women with T2DM was associated with an overall significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer with dose-response relationship.",

We followed 185,181 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1994-2016) and the NHSII (1995-2017), with baseline corresponding to the date metformin was approved for type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment in the US Information on T2D diagnosis, anti-diabetes medications, and other covariates was self-reported at baseline and repeatedly assessed by follow-up questionnaires every 2 years. Breast cancer cases were self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between medication use and breast cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. During 3,324,881 person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 9,192 incident invasive breast cancer cases, of which 451 were among women with T2D. Compared with women without T2D (n = 169,263), neither metformin use (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.81-1.15) nor other anti-diabetic medications use (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.90-1.36) associated with significantly lower breast cancer incidence. Among women with T2D (n = 15,918), compared with metformin never users, metformin ever use was not significantly inversely associated with breast cancer (HR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.74-1.15). Although we observed that past use of metformin was inversely associated with breast cancer in the T2D population (HR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.48-0.94), current use (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.80-1.27) and longer duration of metformin use were not associated with breast cancer (each 2-year interval: HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.95-1.07). Overall, metformin use was not associated with the risk of developing breast cancer among the overall cohort population or among women with T2D.",

      "abstract": "Recent observational studies have shown that metformin use in diabetic patients decreases both cancer incidence and mortality. Metformin use is also independently predictive of pathologic complete response. In the current study, the authors explored the association between metformin use and survival outcomes in patients with triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The Breast Cancer Management System database of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center identified 1448 women who received adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC between 1995 and 2007. Patients were categorized by diabetes status and metformin use. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine the association between metformin use and survival outcomes. The study cohort was comprised of 63 diabetic patients receiving treatment with metformin, 67 diabetic patients not receiving metformin, and 1318 nondiabetic patients. Patients in the diabetic groups tended to be older (P = .005); more diabetic patients were postmenopausal (P = .0007), black (P = .0001), and obese (P < .0001). At a median follow-up of 62 months, there were no significant differences with regard to 5-year DMFS (P = .23), RFS (P = .38), and OS (P = .58) between the 3 groups. Compared with the metformin group, patients who did not receive metformin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.87-3.06 [P = .13]) and nondiabetic patients (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.97-2.71 [P = .06]) tended to have a higher risk of distant metastases. The findings of the current study suggest that metformin use during adjuvant chemotherapy does not significantly impact survival outcomes in diabetic patients with TNBC.",

      "abstract": "Human insulin is commonly used to treat hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, but its potential link with female breast cancer is under debate. This study investigated whether human insulin use might be associated with breast cancer risk in Taiwanese women with type 2 diabetes. The reimbursement databases of all Taiwanese diabetic patients from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2004 and a total of 482,033 women with type 2 diabetes were followed up for breast cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of human insulin exposure (using tertile cutoffs of time since starting insulin, cumulative dose and cumulative duration of insulin) were calculated and the adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression. The potential risk modification by concomitant treatment with metformin, statin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) was also evaluated. There were 59,798 ever-users and 422,235 never-users of human insulin, with respective numbers of incident breast cancer of 559 (0.93 %) and 4,711 (1.12 %), and respective incidence of 207.9 and 215.1 per 100,000 person-years. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) did not show a significant association with insulin [1.033 (0.936-1.139)]. However, patients in the third tertiles of dose-response parameters might show a significantly higher risk of breast cancer while compared to never-users: 1.185 (1.026-1.368), 1.260 (1.096-1.450) and 1.257 (1.094-1.446) for ≥67 months for time since starting insulin, ≥39,000 units for cumulative dose of insulin, and ≥21.8 months for cumulative duration of insulin, respectively. Additional analyses suggested that the breast cancer risk associated with human insulin use might be beneficially modified by concomitant use of metformin, statin and ACEI/ARB. This study discloses a significantly higher risk of breast cancer associated with prolonged use of human insulin. The increased risk of breast cancer associated with human insulin use may be modified by medications such as metformin, statin and ACEI/ARB.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several studies reported that the cancer incidence in type 2 diabetes patients is higher than in the general population. Although a number of risks are shared between cancer and diabetes patients, there have been few studies of its correlation. We evaluated the influences of several factors including low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), albuminuria and use of metformin on the risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. We enrolled 1,320 patients with at least 5 years of follow-up and 73 patients were diagnosed with cancer during this period. The associations of the risk factors with cancer incidence were evaluated by multiple regression analysis. The subjects were placed into two subgroups based on metformin dosage (<1,000 mg/day, ≥1,000 mg/day) and we compared cancer incidence using analysis of covariance. LDL-C and albuminuria were not significantly correlated with cancer risk. In contrast, metformin showed a reverse correlation with cancer risk (P=0.006; relative risk, 0.574). In the metformin nonadministration group, smoking, male gender, and high triglyceride levels tended to be contributing factors without statistical significance. Cancer occurence was lower in the low dose metformin group (less than 1,000 mg/day) (P=0.00). These results suggest that the administration of low dose metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer.",

During 2002-2012, we followed a cohort of 315,890 persons aged 21-87 years with incident diabetes who were insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We used a discrete form of weighted cumulative metformin exposure to evaluate the association of metformin with cancer incidence. This was implemented in a time-dependent covariate Cox model, adjusting for treatment with other glucose-lowering medications, as well as age, sex, ethnic background, socioeconomic status, smoking (for bladder and lung cancer), and parity (for breast cancer). We excluded from the analysis metformin exposure during the year before cancer diagnosis in order to minimize reverse causation of cancer on changes in medication use. Estimated hazard ratios associated with exposure to 1 defined daily dose of metformin over the previous 2-7 years were 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 1.18) for all-sites cancer (excluding prostate and pancreas), 1.05 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.63) for colon cancer, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.97) for bladder cancer, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.78) for lung cancer, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.39) for female breast cancer. Our results do not support an association between metformin treatment and the incidence of major cancers (excluding prostate and pancreas).",

This study aimed to investigate the association between metformin use and pancreatic cancer risk in the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-National Health Screening Cohort (HEALS). Of the individuals in the Korean NHIS-HEALS, 29,271 men and 19,091 women were included in the final analysis after propensity score matching based on age, body mass index, and smoking status. The study population was categorized into three groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM, and non-diabetic users. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the association between metformin use and pancreatic cancer. The median follow-up period was 12.9 years. The estimated pancreatic cancer incidence was highest in metformin users with DM, regardless of sex (P<0.001), and lowest in non-diabetic men and female metformin non-users (P=0.053). The hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for pancreatic cancer incidence in metformin users and non-diabetic individuals were 1.116 (0.648-1.923) and 0.447 (0.259-0.771) in men and 2.769 (1.003-7.642) and 1.451 (0.529-3.984) in women, respectively, after full adjustment. Women with diabetes using metformin are at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than women with diabetes not using metformin. Meanwhile, men with DM using metformin have a similar risk of pancreatic cancer as men with DM not using metformin.",

However, previous observational studies have reported contradictory results, which are likely due to important methodologic limitations. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess whether the use of metformin is associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with type II diabetes. A cohort study of patients newly treated with non-insulin antidiabetic agents was assembled using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where all incident cases of colorectal cancer occurring during follow-up were identified and randomly matched with up to 10 controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RR) of colorectal cancer associated with ever use, and cumulative duration of use of metformin. All models accounted for latency and were adjusted for relevant potential confounding factors. Overall, ever use of metformin was not associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer [RR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-1.18]. Similarly, no dose-response relationship was observed in terms of cumulative duration of use. The use of metformin was not associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with type II diabetes. The results of this study do not support the launch of metformin randomized controlled trials for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that diabetes is a risk factor for endometrial cancer incidence. However, most of these studies used case-control study designs and did not adjust for obesity, an established risk factor for endometrial cancer. In addition, few epidemiological studies have examined the association between diabetes treatment and endometrial cancer risk. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships among diabetes, diabetes treatment and endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). A total of 88 107 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years who were free of cancer and had no hysterectomy at baseline were followed until date of endometrial cancer diagnosis, death, hysterectomy or loss to follow-up, whichever came first. Endometrial cancers were confirmed by central medical record and pathology report review. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for diagnosis of diabetes and metformin treatment as risk factors for endometrial cancer. Over a mean of 11 years of follow-up, 1241 endometrial cancers developed. In the primary analysis that focused on prevalent diabetes at enrolment, compared with women without diabetes, women with self-reported diabetes, and the subset of women with treated diabetes, had significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer without adjusting for BMI (HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.13-1.85 for diabetes, HR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.19-2.07 for treated diabetes). However after adjusting for BMI, the associations between diabetes, diabetes treatment, diabetes duration and the risk of endometrial cancer became non-significant. Elevated risk was noted when considering combining diabetes diagnosed at baseline and during follow-up as time-dependent exposure (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.08-1.59) even after adjusting for BMI. No significant association was observed between metformin use and endometrial cancer risk. Our results suggest that the relationship observed in previous research between diabetes and endometrial cancer incidence may be largely confounded by body weight, although some modest independent elevated risk remains.",

The study then followed these participants prospectively for a mean of 11 years until the outcome (endometrial cancer diagnosis) occurred, consistent with the definition of a prospective observational study. The analysis used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), which is the standard analytical approach for time-to-event data in a cohort design. Furthermore, the paper explicitly states its methodology is based on the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), described as a 'large, prospective cohort study.'

Patients identified in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), previously General Practice Research Database, during 1995-2008 who were initially stabilized on OHA monotherapy, including metformin, sulphonylurea, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or meglitinides, were included in the cohort. New diagnoses of cancer, including malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancies, occurring during the follow-up were identified from the cohort. Age-standardized incidence rates were estimated and compared between metformin and sulphonylurea exposure groups. The age standardized incidences of cancer were 7.5 and 8.5 per 1000 person-years for the metformin and sulphonylurea exposure groups, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratios (HR) for malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancies were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.15) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.43) for sulphonylurea group as compared to the metformin group, respectively. For individual cancers, the HRs were 1.17 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.44), 1.04 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.31) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.11) for colorectal cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. This study provides evidence that cancer incidence in the first few years after starting metformin or sulphonylurea therapy in type 2 diabetes patients is not much affected by choice of hypoglycaemic drug class.",

This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate independent associations of aspirin, metformin, and statin use with gastric cancer incidence and mortality after adjustment for concomitant use of other drugs, using pooled cohort data extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance claim database. Follow-up started on January 1, 2004 and ended at the date of gastric cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2013. Exposures to drugs were defined as cumulative duration of use for aspirin and cumulative defined daily dose for metformin and statin, and were entered as time-dependent variables in Cox analysis models to avoid immortal time bias. Use of aspirin for longer than 182.5 and 547.5 days during 2-year interval was associated with reduced risks of gastric cancer incidence and mortality, respectively. Patients with diabetes were at higher risk of gastric cancer incidence and mortality than nondiabetic people, regardless of metformin treatment. However, metformin use among patients with diabetes was associated with a reduction in gastric cancer mortality in a dose-response manner. Statin use was also associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in the general population, but not with gastric cancer incidence. In conclusion, long-term use of aspirin was independently associated with reduced incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in the general population, but metformin or statin use was only associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in patients with diabetes and in the general population, respectively. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Long-term use of aspirin was independently associated with reduced incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in the general population. Metformin or statin use, however, was only associated with a reduction of gastric cancer mortality in diabetic patients and in the general population in a dose-response manner, respectively.",

      "abstract": "A large prospective study in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the German D2C cohort, is presently being enumerated to investigate risk factors of incident cancer in diabetic patients. A disease management program was offered, on a voluntary basis, to all T2D patients who were members of a statutory health insurance fund in Germany. This first feasibility report uses data from 26.742 T2D patients, who were 40 to 79 years old, resided in the Muenster District, and who were enrolled between June 2003 and July 2008. Cancer cases were identified through the regional Cancer Registry. Invasive cancer cases were identified using probabilistic record linkage procedures and pseudonymised personal identifiers. Censoring date was December 31, 2008. We included only first cancers, leaving 12.650 male and 14.092 female T2D with a total of 88.778 person-years (py). We computed standardised incidence ratios (SIR) for external comparisons and we employed Cox regression models and hazard ratios (HR) within the cohort. We identified 759 first cancers among male T2D patients (18.7 per 1,000 py) and 605 among females (12.7 per 1,000 py). The risk of any incident cancer in T2D was raised (SIR = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [1.10 - 1.21]), in particular for cancer of the liver (SIR = 1.94 [1.15 - 2.94]) and pancreas (SIR = 1.45 [1.07-1.92]). SIRs decreased markedly with time after T2D diagnosis. In Cox models, adjusting for diabetes duration, body mass index and sex, insulin therapy was related to higher cancer risk (HR = 1.25 [1.17 - 1.33]). No effect was seen for metformin. Our study demonstrates feasibility of record linkage between DMP and cancer registries. These first cohort results confirm previous reports. It is envisaged to enhance this cohort by inclusion of further regions of the state, expansion of the follow-up times, and collection of a more detailed medication history.",

      "abstract": "Racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer is under studied in men with diabetes who are at a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer. This study assessed the race/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer incidence for men with type II diabetes (T2D) and whether the impact of metformin on prostate cancer incidence varied by race/ethnicity. We conducted a retrospective study in 76,733 male veterans with T2D during 2003 to 2012. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for covariates and propensity scores of metformin use and race/ethnic group membership was utilized to compute the HR of prostate cancer incidence associated with race/ethnicity and compare HR associated with metformin use between race/ethnic groups. Mean follow-up was 6.4 ± 2.8 years; 7% were Hispanics; 17% were African Americans (AA); mean age was 67.8 ± 9.8 years; 5.2% developed prostate cancer; and 38.9% used metformin. Among these diabetic men without metformin use, prostate cancer incidence was higher in Hispanics and AA than in non-Hispanic White (NHW). Use of metformin alone or metformin + statins was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics compared with NHW, but not between AA and NHW. Use of metformin + finasteride was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics and AA compared with NHW. Our results suggested that metformin treatment could be a potential strategy to reduce prostate cancer incidence in the minority populations who are at high risk for fatal prostate cancer. It will be important to further examine the pleiotropic effects of metformin in multi-race/ethnic prospective studies to better inform clinical management and potentially reduce racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer incidence among diabetic men.

The National Health Insurance reimbursement database of Taiwanese male patients with new-onset T2DM between 1998 and 2002 and aged ⩾40years (n=395,481) were retrieved to follow up prostate cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Metformin was treated as a time-dependent variable. Of the patients studied, 209,269 were never-users and 186,212 were ever-users. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate prostate cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios using Cox regression for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in various subgroups, using time-dependent and non-time-dependent approaches. During the follow-up, 2776 metformin ever-users and 9642 never-users developed prostate cancer, representing an incidence of 239.42 and 737.10 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) after adjustment for propensity score (PS) for ever- versus never-users was 0.467 (0.446-0.488). The PS-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 0.741 (0.698-0.786), 0.474 (0.441-0.508) and 0.231 (0.212-0.253), respectively (P-trend<0.001); and were 0.742 (0.700-0.786), 0.436 (0.406-0.468) and 0.228 (0.208-0.251) for the respective cumulative dose (P-trend<0.001). Sensitivity analyses consistently supported a protective effect of metformin on incident prostate cancer. Metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of incident prostate cancer in Taiwanese male patients with T2DM.",

A retrospective cohort of 92,366 women with newly diagnosed T2D was obtained from a diabetes register (FinDM). 590 endometrioid ECs were observed during the follow-up time. Poisson regression was utilized to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the endometrioid EC in relation to the use of metformin, other oral ADM, insulin and statins. Nested case-control analyses were performed, where up to 20 controls were matched for age and duration of DM for each EC case. The HRs were estimated by conditional logistic regression for never/ever and cumulative use of different forms of ADM and statins. In the case-control analyses the use of metformin (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51) and other oral ADM (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.50) was associated with an increased incidence of endometrioid EC compared to no ADM use. No difference was observed between metformin users and those using other oral ADMs. The use of statins was inversely related to the incidence of endometrioid EC (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94). Results from the full cohort analysis supported this finding. In our study the use of metformin or other oral forms of ADM was not associated with a lowered risk of endometrioid EC in women with T2D. Instead statins were observed to be inversely associated with endometrioid EC in this population.",

All 11,140 participants from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00145925) were studied. Cancer incidence and cancer mortality was compared in groups randomised to intensive or standard glucose control. Information on events during follow-up was obtained from serious adverse event reports and death certificates. HRs (95% CI) were calculated for all cancers, all solid cancers, cancer deaths and site-specific cancers. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 363 and 337 cancer events were reported in the intensive and standard control groups, respectively (incidence 1.39/100 person-years [PY] and 1.28/100 PY; HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.93-1.26]). The incidences of all solid cancers and cancer deaths were 1.25/100 PY and 0.55/100 PY in the intensive group and 1.15/100 PY and 0.63/100 PY in the standard group (HR 1.09[95% CI 0.93–1.27] for solid cancers, and 0.88 [0.71–1.10] for cancer death) [corrected].Across all the major organ systems studied, no significant differences in the cancer incidences were observed in the intensive and standard control groups. More intensive glucose control achieved with a regimen that included greater use of gliclazide, insulin, metformin and other agents, did not affect the risk of cancer events or death in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes, while avoiding previous biases. Using the U.K. General Practice Research Database, we assembled a cohort of patients newly treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) between 1988 and 2009. A nested case-control analysis was conducted, where case subjects with lung cancer occurring during follow-up were matched with up to 10 control subjects for age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of lung cancer associated with ever use of metformin, along with measures of duration and cumulative dose. Models were adjusted for potential confounders, which included smoking. The cohort included 115,923 new users of OHAs, with 1,061 patients diagnosed with lung cancer during follow-up (rate 2.0/1,000 person-years). Metformin use was not associated with a decreased rate of lung cancer (rate ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.76-1.17]). No dose-response was observed by number of prescriptions received, cumulative duration of use, and dose. Metformin use is not associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. The decreased risk reported in other observational studies is likely due to bias from methodological shortcomings. Nonetheless, greater consideration should be given to clarify inconsistencies between experimental models and population studies.",

A total of 323,430 subjects was enrolled (301,905 individuals without diabetes [No DM], 8643 diabetic patients with metformin treatment [metformin users], and 12,882 diabetic patients without metformin treatment [metformin non-users]). The median follow-up period was 12.7 years. Cumulative incidence of overall cancer was 7.9% (7.7, 10.3, and 11.1% in No DM, metformin users and non-users, respectively). Compared to metformin non-users, the fully adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of metformin users and No DM for overall cancer incidence were 0.73 (0.66-0.81) and 0.75 (0.64-0.88), respectively, in men and 0.83 (0.78-0.89) and 0.81 (0.72-0.92) in women. Diabetic patients receiving metformin treatment, and individuals without diabetes were at lower risk for cancer incidence than diabetic patients without metformin treatment.",

This study included a total of 732,199 participants who underwent a national health check-up from 2002 to 2003. Lung cancer incidence and mortality were identified using a registered lung cancer diagnosis code (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, code C34) and the Korean National Death Registry. The study participants were followed up from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. Medication exposure was defined by the cumulative duration of use and cumulative defined daily dose per 2-year interval. To avoid immortal-time bias, drug exposure was inserted as a time-dependent variable in Cox analysis, which evaluated the associations of these medications with lung cancer. Metformin use had a protective association with lung cancer incidence (p's for trend 0.008) and mortality (p's for trend < 0.001) in a dose-response fashion, and these associations were prominent among participants with a metformin cumulative defined daily dose of 547.5 and above compared with patients without diabetes. Lung cancer mortality was dose-dependently reduced with the use of aspirin (p's for trends 0.046) and statin (p's for trends < 0.001). The combined use of aspirin, statins, and metformin exhibited more prominent protective associations with lung cancer risk and mortality. The use of aspirin, metformin, and statins had independent protective associations with lung cancer mortality, and metformin had an inverse association with lung cancer risk. Further studies are necessary to develop clinically applicable anticancer strategies using these drugs for the reduction of lung cancer and related mortality.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a major health concern for breast cancer survivors, being associated with high recurrence and reduced efficacy during cancer treatment. Metformin treatment is associated with reduced breast cancer incidence, recurrence and mortality. To better understand the underlying mechanisms through which metformin may reduce recurrence, we aimed to conduct metabolic profiling of overweight/obese breast cancer survivors before and after metformin treatment. Fasting plasma samples from 373 overweight or obese breast cancer survivors randomly assigned to metformin (n = 194) or placebo (n = 179) administration were collected at baseline, after 6 months (Reach For Health trial), and after 12 months (MetBreCS trial). Archival samples were concurrently analyzed using three complementary methods: untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolomics, targeted LC-MS metabolomics (AbsoluteIDQ p180, Biocrates), and gas chromatography phospholipid fatty acid assay. Multivariable linear regression models and family-wise error correction were used to identify metabolites that significantly changed after metformin treatment. Participants (n = 352) with both baseline and study end point samples available were included in the analysis. After adjusting for confounders such as study center, age, body mass index and false discovery rate, we found that metformin treatment was significantly associated with decreased levels of citrulline, arginine, tyrosine, caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline, and increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, proline, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate, alanine and indoxyl-sulphate. Long-chain unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC ae C36:4, PC ae C38:5, PC ae C36:5 and PC ae C38:6) were significantly decreased with the metformin treatment, as were phospholipid-derived long-chain n-6 fatty acids. The metabolomic profiles of metformin treatment suggest change in specific biochemical pathways known to impair cancer cell growth including activation of CYP1A2, alterations in fatty acid desaturase activity, and altered metabolism of specific amino acids, including impaired branched chain amino acid catabolism. Our results in overweight breast cancer survivors identify new metabolic effects of metformin treatment that may mechanistically contribute to reduced risk of recurrence in this population and reduced obesity-related cancer risk reported in observational studies.

There have been conflicting reports regarding an association between metformin and cancer risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between metformin use and the incidence of cancer in Koreans with T2DM.Data from The Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP, 2006-2014), a nationwide, large-scale, prospective, multicenter cohort study in Korea, were used to study patients with T2DM. Patients ≥30 years old whose complete medical records were available were included in this study. Patients with a history of any cancer on KNDP registration or those who had been diagnosed with any type of cancer within 1 year of metformin use were excluded. Survival curves with respect to the incidence of cancer were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.During a mean 5.8 years of follow-up, 164 of the 1918 study patients (335 metformin nonusers and 1583 metformin users) developed cancer. The incidence per 1000 person-years was 21.8 in metformin nonusers and 13.2 in metformin users. Metformin users had a reduced risk of cancer, even after adjustment for demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters, diabetic complications, and other antidiabetic medications (hazard ratio 0.513, 95% confidence interval 0.318-0.826, P = .0060). Subgroup analysis of metformin users showed a reduced risk of cancer in males, patients < 65 years of age, patients with a T2DM duration < 5 years, nonobese patients, nonsmokers, and good glycemic control group.This large-scale, prospective, multicenter cohort study demonstrated an association between metformin use and reduced cancer risk in patients with T2DM.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications and cancer risks. Stomach cancer is the most common cancer in Korea. Although the survival rate of stomach cancer has improved, the disease burden is still high. This retrospective study investigated the association between metformin use and stomach cancer incidence in a Korean population using the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort database. Participants aged 40-80 years old at the baseline period (2002-2003) were enrolled. The study population was categorized into three groups of metformin non-users with DM, metformin users with DM, and individuals without DM (No DM group). A total of 347,895 participants (14,922 metformin non-users, 9891 metformin users, and 323,082 individuals without DM) were included in the final analysis. The median follow-up duration was 12.70 years. The estimated cumulative incidence of stomach cancer was highest in metformin non-users and lowest in the No DM group (men vs. women: 3.75 vs. 1.97% in metformin non-users, 2.91 vs. 1.53% in metformin users, and 2.54 vs. 0.95% in the No DM group). Compared with metformin non-users, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stomach cancer incidence of metformin users and the No DM group were 0.710 (0.579-0.870) and 0.879 (0.767-1.006) in men and 0.700 (0.499-0.981) and 0.701 (0.544-0.903) in women, respectively, after full adjustment. Metformin users with DM in the Korean population were at lower risk of stomach cancer incidence after controlling for potential confounding factors.",

This study investigated the association between metformin use and thyroid cancer risk in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The reimbursement databases of all diabetic patients from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2006 and 1,414,723 patients with type 2 diabetes were followed for thyroid cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of metformin exposure using tertile cutoffs for cumulative duration of therapy and cumulative dose were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted. There were 795,321 ever-users and 619,402 never-users, with respective numbers of incident thyroid cancer of 683 (0.09%) and 1,614 (0.26%), and respective incidence of 24.09 and 87.33 per 100,000 person-years. The overall fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.683 (0.598-0.780), and all categories of the dose-response parameters showed significantly lower risk with P-trends < 0.0001. The protective effect of metformin on thyroid cancer incidence was also supported by sensitivity analyses, disregarding age (< 50 or ≥ 50 years) and sex; and was not affected by excluding users of insulin, sulfonylurea, and insulin and/or sulfonylurea respectively, by previous diagnosis of other cancers or by potential detection examinations that might lead to differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer. This study provides evidence for the first time that metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes may reduce the risk of thyroid cancer.",

      "abstract": "Population studies have suggested that metformin use in diabetic patients decreases cancer incidence and mortality. Metformin inhibits the growth of cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo. However, there is little clinical data to support this. Our purpose was to determine whether metformin use was associated with a change in pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We identified 2,529 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer between 1990 and 2007. Patients were compared by groups: 68 diabetic patients taking metformin, 87 diabetic patients not taking metformin, and 2,374 nondiabetic patients. pCR rates were compared between the three groups using chi(2) tests of independence and compared pair- wise using a binomial test of proportions. Factors predictive of pCR were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. The rate of pCR was 24% in the metformin group, 8.0% in the nonmetformin group, and 16% in the nondiabetic group (P = .02). Pairwise comparisons between the metformin and nonmetformin groups (P = .007) and the nonmetformin and nondiabetic groups (P = .04) were significant. Comparison of the pCR rates between the metformin and nondiabetic groups trended toward but did not meet significance (P = .10). Metformin use was independently predictive of pCR (odds ratio, 2.95; P = .04) after adjustment for diabetes, body mass index, age, stage, grade, receptor status, and neoadjuvant taxane use. Diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving metformin and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a higher pCR rate than do diabetics not receiving metformin. Additional studies to evaluate the potential of metformin as an antitumor agent are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Docetaxel (DOCE) is a standard of care in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Several retrospective studies suggested a decrease in Prostate Cancer incidence and mortality with metformin (MET). MET has also demonstrated anti-tumor activity in Prostate Cancer preclinical models, with increased apoptosis when added to DOCE. We aimed at exploring the role of MET in combination with DOCE in mCRPC. Non-diabetic mCRPC patients were randomly assigned to receive DOCE 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 21 days + prednisone (5 mg. BID) with either MET 850 mg BID (D+M) or placebo (D+P) up to 10 cycles. Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response ≥50% from baseline was the primary end point. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity and quality of life (QoL). Out of 99 patients were randomized (D+M = 50; D+P = 49) in 10 French centers. The median follow-up was 86 (IQR 73-88) months. The PSA-response rate reached 66% in the D+M arm, but was not different from that observed in the D+P arm (63%, P = 0,94). In the D+M and D+P arms, the ORR was 28% and 24%, the median PFS was 7.8 and 6.0 months and the median OS was 27 and 20 months (ns), respectively. Diarrhea grade I to II was more frequent in the MET arm (66% vs. 43%). No impairment of QoL was observed. MET addition failed to improve the standard DOCE regimen in mCRPC. Further research targeting tumor cell metabolism should be performed.",

      "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that incidence of and mortality from several malignancies are increased among diabetic patients. Whether certain treatment modalities, including use of metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulins, affect cancer incidence or mortality and whether use of long-acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir may increase cancer incidence more than traditional human insulins are debated. The objective was to investigate the association between specific glucose-lowering agents and cancer incidence in diabetic members of an Israeli health maintenance organization. We studied a cohort of 36,342 diabetic patients aged at least 18 years with no history of cancer or treatment with insulin as of January 1, 2003. For the period from January 2003 to December 2007, we searched pharmacy records for purchases of glucose-lowering agents, including metformin, sulfonylureas, human insulin, and analogue insulins. Incident cancer diagnoses were identified from the health maintenance organization cancer registry. We studied the association of cancer incidence with the use of specific glucose-lowering agents, controlling for age, sex, and baseline glycohemoglobin measurement. Cancer was diagnosed in 6% of the study cohort during 164,652 person-years of follow-up time. Cancer incidence increased with age and varied with medication purchasing patterns. On multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.049; confidence interval [CI], 1.045-1.052), male sex (HR, 1.16; CI, 1.065-1.264), and number of insulin purchases (HR, 1.007; CI, 1.001-1.012) were significantly associated with increased cancer risk, whereas number of metformin purchases was associated with reduced cancer risk (HR, 0.996; CI, 0.994-0.998). Male sex, age, and human insulin purchases were associated with increased cancer incidence, whereas metformin purchases were associated with decreased cancer risk. There was a trend for increased cancer incidence associated with use of long-acting insulin analogues, but the number of long-acting insulin analogue users was too small for risk estimates to be conclusive.",

The present study is aimed at assessing the long-term association of different insulin analogues with cancer incidence. A nested case-control study dataset was generated from the cohort study dataset (n = 1,340 insulin-treated diabetic outpatients) by sampling control subjects from the risk sets. For each case subject, the control subjects (up to five) were chosen randomly from those members of the cohort who are at risk for the same follow-up time of the case subject. Five-year age classes, sex, and BMI classes (<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, and >or=30 kg/m(2)) were considered as additional categorical matching variables. During a median follow-up of 75.9 months (interquartile range 27.4-133.7), 112 case subjects of incident cancer were compared with 370 matched control subjects. A significantly higher mean daily dose of glargine was observed in case subjects than in control subjects (0.24 IU/kg/day [0.10-0.39] versus 0.16 IU/kg/day [0.12-0.24], P = 0.036). Incident cancer was associated with a dose of glargine >or=0.3 IU/kg/day even after adjusting for Charlson comorbidity score, other types of insulin administration, and metformin exposure (odds ratio 5.43 [95% CI 2.18-13.53], P < 0.001). No association between incident cancer and insulin doses was found for human insulin or other analogues. The possibility of association between cancer and higher glargine doses suggests that dosages should always be considered when assessing the possible association of insulin and its analogues with cancer.",

Data were collected from a Finnish nationwide diabetes database (FinDM). The study cohort consisted of women diagnosed with T2D in 1996-2011 in Finland. In full-cohort analysis, Poisson regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) in relation to use of metformin, insulin, other forms of oral ADM and statins. In nested case-control analysis, up to 20 controls were matched for age and duration of diabetes to each case of breast cancer. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate HRs in relation to medication use and cumulative use of different forms of ADM, and statins. 2300 women were diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up. No difference in breast cancer incidence was observed between metformin users [HR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.11] or statin users (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.05) compared with non-users. In nested case-control analysis the results were similar. Use of insulin (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.36) was associated with a slightly increased incidence of breast cancer. No evidence of an association between the use of metformin or statins and the incidence of breast cancer in women with T2D was found. Among insulin users, a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer was observed.",

The full-cohort analysis used Poisson regression to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) for breast cancer incidence based on medication exposure (metformin, statins, insulin). The subsequent nested case-control analysis confirmed this observational design by selecting incident breast cancer cases and matching them to controls from the cohort population at risk, retrospectively assessing cumulative medication dose (DDDs), which is characteristic of a Case-Control approach implemented within a larger Cohort frame.

      "abstract": "Whether metformin therapy affects bladder cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been extensively investigated. The reimbursement databases of all Taiwanese patients with a new diagnosis of T2DM between 1998 and 2002 (n = 940,708) were retrieved from the National Health Insurance for follow-up of bladder cancer up to the end of 2009. Metformin was treated as a time-dependent variable, and of these patients, 532,519 were never-users and 408,189 were ever-users of metformin. A time-dependent approach was applied in the calculation of bladder cancer incidence and in the estimation of hazard ratios by Cox regression for ever-users, never-users, and subgroups of metformin exposure (using tertile cutoffs of cumulative duration of therapy and cumulative dose). During the study period, 1,847 (0.45%) metformin ever-users and 6,213 (1.17%) metformin never-users developed bladder cancer, representing an incidence of 72.03 and 189.22 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-sex-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for ever- versus never-users were 0.382 (0.360-0.405) and 0.600 (0.564-0.638), respectively. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second, and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 1.034 (0.954-1.120), 0.696 (0.632-0.766), and 0.258 (0.229-0.291), respectively (P trend <0.0001). Similarly, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second, and third tertiles of cumulative dose of metformin were 0.997 (0.920-1.080), 0.615 (0.559-0.677), and 0.285 (0.253-0.321), respectively (P trend <0.0001). This study suggests that metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of bladder cancer in patients with T2DM.",

The reimbursement databases of Taiwanese female patients with a new diagnosis of T2DM between 1998 and 2002 (n = 476,282) were retrieved from the National Health Insurance for follow-up of breast cancer until the end of 2009. Metformin was treated as a time-dependent variable; and of these patients, 285,087 were never-users and 191,195 were ever-users. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate breast cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios by Cox regression for ever-users, never-users, and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). During follow-up, 2,412 (1.26 %) metformin ever-users and 9,322 (2.10 %) never-users developed breast cancer, representing an incidence of 201.08 and 535.88 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95 % confidence intervals) for ever- versus never-users was 0.630 (0.597-0.665). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the first, second, and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy were 1.122 (1.043-1.207), 0.754 (0.692-0.820), and 0.280 (0.253-0.310), respectively, (P-trend <0.0001); and 1.099 (1.021-1.182), 0.664 (0.611-0.723), and 0.311 (0.281-0.344), respectively, (P-trend <0.0001), for cumulative dose of metformin. Metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.",

We conducted a longitudinal observational cohort study using 3 population-based databases in Taiwan. Using propensity score matching, we compared patients with type 2 diabetes who enrolled in a P4P program with a similar group of patients who did not enroll in the in P4P program (non-P4P). Primary end points of interest were risks of incident cancer and all-cause, cancer-specific, and diabetes-related mortality. Total person-years and incidence and mortality rates per 1,000 person-years were calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and competing risk regression were used in the analysis. Overall, our findings indicated that the diabetes P4P program was not significantly associated with lower risks of cancer incidence, but it was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.63), cancer-specific mortality (aSHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-1.00), and diabetes-related mortality (aSHR, 0.54: 95% CI, 0.49-0.60). Metformin, thiazolidinediones, and α glucosidase inhibitors were associated with lower risks of cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality. Our findings provide evidence of the potential benefit of diabetes P4P programs in reducing risks of all-cause mortality and competing causes of death attributable to cancer-specific and diabetes-related mortality among type 2 diabetes patients.",

The aim was to analyze the relationships between DPP-4i therapy with risk of metastases in type 2 diabetes patients with breast, prostate and digestive organ cancers. Type 2 diabetes patients with first diagnoses of breast, prostate or digestive organ cancer were selected in general and internal medicine practices (Disease Analyzer Germany: 01/2008-12/2014). Propensity score matching between DPP-4i users and non-users was carried out for age, sex, diabetes duration, and metformin use. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for metastases further adjusting for HbA1c, body mass index, comorbidity and co-therapy with glucose-lowering drugs (3-4years follow-up). 668 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, 906 with prostate cancer and 908 with digestive organ cancer were analyzed. In Cox regression, use of DPP-4i was not associated with an increased risk of metastases in patients with breast (adjusted HR, 95%CI: 1.00, 0.49-2.02), prostate (0.98, 0.54-1.77) or digestive organ cancers (0.97, 0.57-1.66). This first observational study in patients with type 2 diabetes and breast, prostate or digestive organ cancer found no increased risk of metastases in DPP-4i users.",

We identified a clinical cohort of male veterans in the United States who were ≥65years old with T2D and free from ARCs during 2002-2003. ARC diagnoses during 2004-2012 were analyzed using latent class modeling adjusted for confounders. The cohort consisted of 41,204 T2D men with age 74.6±5.8years, HbA1c 6.5±0.97%, and 8393 (20.4%) metformin users. Four ARC classes were identified. 'Healthy Class' (53.6%): metformin reduced likelihoods of all ARCs (from 0.14% in dementia to 6.1% in CVD). 'High Cancer Risk Class' (11.6%): metformin reduced likelihoods of CVD (13.3%), cancer (45.5%), depression (5.0%), and FRD (13.7%).

The aim of this study is to study the change in mtDNA-CN in patients with PCOS who were treated with metformin. This is a prospective cohort of patients with PCOS, who received metformin for one year. From 2009 to 2015, 88 women diagnosed with PCOS, based on the Rotterdam criteria, were enrolled. Serial measurements of mtDNA-CN, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), anthropometric, metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory markers were obtained before and after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. A significant decrease in mtDNA-CN was seen over the course of one year. Other markers, including 8-OHdG, testosterone, free androgen index, blood pressure and liver enzymes, also decreased in the same interval. On regression analysis, there was a significant association between the change in mtDNA-CN and serum total testosterone, and no association between mtDNA-CN and metabolic factors. Treatment with metformin is associated with a time-dependent decrease in mtDNA-CN in patients with PCOS who are treated over the course of one year. This may signify a reduction in mitochondria dysfunction. The change in mtDNA-CN corresponds to a similar change in serum total testosterone, and suggests a possible relationship between mtDNA-CN and testosterone. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00172523 .

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of adding metformin to chemotherapy regimen over the percentage of early relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A prospective, longitudinal and experimental study was performed in patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Hospital General de México. They were divided in two groups: first group received chemotherapy + metformin (850 mg three times a day); second group only received standard chemotherapy. The sample was randomized 3:1 in favor of the second group. 93 patients were included (73 treated with chemotherapy + metformin and 20 received standard chemotherapy), with 303 ± 53 days of follow-up. Complete remission was higher in the group without metformin (81.3 % [n = 61] versus 70 % [n = 14]), which also presented more patients with relapse (47.9 % versus 25 %). Overall survival at one year was of 68 % and free survival disease was 64 %, without significant differences between groups. Absence of metformin was the only variable of adverse prognostic considered significant (p = 0.55). Cox regression showed that adding metfomin reduced 56 % the risk of relapse. The adding metformin to the treatment of leukemias showed that was useful in our research. However, randomized and double-blind studies must be designed in order to express final recommendations about its use.",

(2) Methods: In a nationwide population-based longitudinal study, data were retrieved from the 1998 to 2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. ICD9-CM codes 256.4, 710.0, and 642.X were identified for the corresponding diagnoses of PCOS, SLE, and GH-PE, respectively, which were further confirmed by inspection of medical claims data for ultrasonography findings, laboratory tests, blood pressure measurements and examinations of urine protein to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. To clarify the risks of primiparous GH-PE, the study excluded women diagnosed with PCOS or SLE at <15 or >45 years of age, pre-existing chronic hypertension, GH-PE before PCOS and SLE, and abortion or termination before 20 weeks' gestation. For women affected by prepregnancy PCOS or SLE individually, each pregnant woman was age-matched to four pregnant women without PCOS or SLE. Logistic regression analyses were applied to report odds ratios (ORs) for the risks of GH-PE after adjustment for age, occupation, urbanization, economic status, and other co-morbidities. (3) Results: Among 8070 and 2430 women with prepregnancy PCOS and SLE retrieved from a population of 1,000,000 residents, 1953 (24.20%) and 820 (33.74%) had subsequent primiparous pregnancies that were analyzable and compared with 7812 and 3280 pregnancies without prepregnancy PCOS and SLE, respectively. GH-PE occurred more frequently in pregnancies with prepregnancy PCOS (5.79% vs. 2.23%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and SLE (3.41% vs. 1.80%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) as compared to those without PCOS and SLE. Further analysis revealed that prepregnancy PCOS (adjusted OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.83-3.05) and SLE (adjusted OR = 1.95; 95%CI: 1.23-3.10) were individually associated with GH-PE. The risk of GH-PE was not reduced in women with prepregnancy PCOS receiving metformin treatment (<i>p =</i> 0.22). (4) Conclusions: Prepregnancy PCOS and SLE are independent and significant risk factors for the occurrence of GH-PE. Because the peripartum complications are much higher among pregnancies with GH-PE, the at-risk woman should be informed and well-prepared during her pregnancy and delivery.",

      "abstract": "Moving from the correlation between insulin-resistance and PCOS, metformin has been administered in some PCOS women improving ovulatory and metabolic functions and decreasing androgen levels. Inconsistency and unpredictability of response to metformin limit its extensive use. Aim of this study was to identify reliable predictors of response to metformin therapy for weight loss and reduction in plasma androgen levels using ANNs (artificial neural networks). One hundred eight consecutive women with PCOS (ESHRE/ASRM 2003 Rotterdam criteria) treated with metformin 1500 mg/day, at inclusion and every 6 months underwent to a complete clinical, endocrine/metabolic assessment and ultrasonographic evaluation. Therapy outcomes were BMI reduction (≥1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in overweight/obese and free-androgen-index (FAI) decrease (≥1%) in hyperandrogenemic women. Semantic connectivity maps (SCMs) were obtained through Auto-CM, a fourth generation ANN, to compare patients' baseline clinical features to the treatment outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the major predictor in drop-out patients and the associated risk. At 6 months 54 out of 103 (52,4%) obese patients showed BMI reduction and 45 out of 89 (50,6%) hyperandrogenemic women showed FAI decrease. The further response rates at 12 months were 30,6 and 47%, respectively. SCMs showed a clear polarization for both the outcomes with elevated accuracy. Treatment responsiveness resulted strictly related to oligo-amenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia at baseline. In addition, lower serum testosterone levels at baseline were found to be the major predictor of treatment discontinuation. In women with PCOS, menstrual pattern imbalance and ovarian androgens excess are the best predictors of metformin response. They may pave the way for a rethinking of the criteria for evaluating hyperandrogenism in order to better define the large population included in the diagnosis of PCOS. Baseline plasma testosterone level can serve as a sensitive marker to predict treatment compliance.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence from observational studies has suggested that metformin may be beneficial in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, to the authors' knowledge, none of these studies was conducted in a US population. Because environmental factors such as Western diet and obesity are implicated in the causation of CRC, a large case-control study was performed to assess the effects of metformin on the incidence of CRC in a US population. MarketScan databases were used to identify diabetic patients with CRC. A case was defined as having an incident diagnosis of CRC. Up to 2 controls matched for age, sex, and geographical region were selected for each case. Metformin exposure was assessed by prescription tracking within the 12-month period before the index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for multiple potential confounders and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs). The mean age of the study participants was 55 years and 57 years, respectively, in the control and case groups (P = 1.0). Approximately 60% of the study participants were male and 40% were female in each group. In the multivariable model, any metformin use was associated with a 15% reduction in the odds of CRC (AOR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.95 [P = .007]). After adjusting for health care use, the beneficial effect of metformin was reduced to 12% (AOR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.00 [P = .05]). The dose-response analyses demonstrated no significant association with metformin dose, duration, or total exposure. Metformin use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of developing CRC among diabetic patients in the United States.",

The study then retrospectively assessed exposure (metformin use, dose, and duration) by tracking prescription data in the 12 months prior to the index date (date of CRC diagnosis). This approach—selecting based on outcome and looking backward for exposure—is the hallmark of a case-control study, typically analyzed using conditional logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs), which was done here.",

However, it is not known if it is acutely cardioprotective in patients taking metformin at the time of AMI. We compared patient outcomes according to metformin status at the time of admission for fatal and non-fatal AMI in a large cohort of patients in England. This study used linked data from primary care, hospital admissions and death registry from 4.7 million inhabitants in England, as part of the CALIBER resource. The primary endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction requiring hospitalisation, stroke and cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were heart failure (HF) hospitalisation and all-cause mortality. 4,030 patients with T2DM and incident AMI recorded between January 1998 and October 2010 were included. At AMI admission, 63.9% of patients were receiving metformin and 36.1% another oral hypoglycaemic drug. Median follow-up was 343 (IQR: 1-1436) days. Adjusted analyses showed an increased hazard of the composite endpoint in metformin users compared to non-users (HR 1.09 [1.01-1.19]), but not of the secondary endpoints. The higher risk of the composite endpoint in metformin users was only observed in people taking metformin at AMI admission, whereas metformin use post-AMI was associated with a reduction in risk of all-cause mortality (0.76 [0.62-0.93], P = 0.009). Our study suggests that metformin use at the time of first AMI is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM, while its use post-AMI might be beneficial. Further investigation in well-designed randomised controlled trials is indicated, especially in view of emerging evidence of cardioprotection from sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperinsulinemia; thus it has been postulated that insulin-lowering drugs, such as metformin, might be a useful long-term choice. We evaluated the effects of 6 months' administration of metformin on clinical and endocrine indices in PCOS patients. Forty-two hyperinsulinemic women with PCOS were continuously treated with metformin for 6 months. Gonadotropins, androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), insulin, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), lipid profile and clinical indices (menstrual length, body mass index (BMI), Ferriman-Gallwey score and waist/hip ratio (WHR)) were studied before and after metformin treatment. All women experienced a normalization of menstrual cycle length (reduction rate, 36.9%), a significant decrease in luteinizing hormone, insulin and androgen levels and an increase in SHBG plasma concentrations, with a concomitant decrease in cycle length and WHR. Significant changes were observed in the lipid profile. According to baseline androgen levels, patients were divided into two groups: 20 normoandrogenic and 17 hyperandrogenic women. The greatest decline of androgens, BMI and Ferriman-Gallwey score was observed in hyperandrogenic patients. Lowering of androgenicity was independent of BMI. Significant changes in lipid profile were observed in both groups after metformin treatment. These results suggest that metformin is effective in decreasing hyperandrogenism, mainly by reducing insulin levels. This leads to an improvement of clinical manifestations of PCOS and, in particular, of hyperandrogenism.",

We want to compare the long-term respiratory endpoints of metformin use and nonuse in patients with T2DM and COPD. This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with T2DM and COPD from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Program between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012. Main outcomes were hospitalized bacterial pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and lung cancer. In total, 20,644 propensity score-matched metformin users and nonusers were assessed. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of metformin use relative to nonuse for bacterial pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD, NIPPV, IMV, and lung cancer were 1.17 (1.11-1.23), 1.34 (1.26-1.43), 0.99 (0.89-1.10), 1.10 (1.03-1.17), and 1.12 (0.96-1.30). Metformin use also exhibited significant dose-response relationship with respect to the risks of bacterial pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD and IMV. Consistent results were found in the sensitivity test. This nationwide cohort study demonstrated that in patients with T2DM and COPD, metformin use was associated with higher risks of pneumonia, hospitalization for COPD, and IMV. If patients with COPD use metformin, vigilance with regard to their pulmonary condition may be required.",

The objectives were to (1) evaluate if the prior use of ADM was associated with BC stage at diagnosis and (2) identify and compare patient characteristics among BC patients using different ADMs. Newly diagnosed female BC patients exposed to any medication during one year prior to cancer diagnosis were identified in 2008-2013 Linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Stage at diagnosis, categorized as early and advanced, was the primary outcome. Chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics and logistic regression models were applied to examine the effect while controlling for patient's characteristics. A total of 1,719 female BC patients used ADM while 6,084 patients were non-ADM users. Although a higher proportion of ADM users (20.36%) were diagnosed with advanced stage compared to the non-ADM users (14.46%), the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for the patients' characteristics. Besides, insulin users were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage (adjusted odds ratio 1.69; 95% CI 1.15, 2.48) compared to metformin users. The association between ADM use and BC diagnostic characteristics varied based on different treatments.",

We assessed the hypothesis that diet-metformin (MET) lessens the physiological gestational increase in IR and reduces gestational weight gain, thus reducing GD. Preconception, in an out-patient clinical research centre, MET 1.5 (eight pregnancies) to 2.55 g/day (34 pregnancies) was started. Women with body mass index <25 or >or=25 kg/m(2) were given a 2000 or 1500 calorie/day, high-protein (26% of calories), low-carbohydrate (44%) diet. Calorie restrictions were dropped after conception. On MET, GD developed in three out of 42 pregnancies (7.1%). Median entry weight (94.5 kg) fell to 82.7 on MET at the last preconception visit (P = 0.0001), fell further to 81.6 during the first trimester, was 83.6 in the second trimester, and 89.1 kg in the third trimester. Median weight gain during pregnancy was 3.5 kg. The median percentage reduction in serum insulin was 40% on MET at the last preconception visit; insulin did not increase in the first or second trimesters (P > 0.05), and rose 10% in the third trimester. The median percentage reduction in HOMA IR was 46% on MET at the last preconception visit; IR did not increase (P > 0.05) in the first, second or third trimesters. HOMA insulin secretion fell 45% on MET at the last preconception visit, did not increase in the first trimester, rose 24% in the second trimester, and rose 109% in the third trimester. Testosterone fell 30% on MET at the last preconception visit (P = 0.01) and then rose 74, 61 and 95% during trimesters 1, 2 and 3; median testosterone during the third trimester did not differ from pre-treatment levels. By reducing preconception weight, insulin, IR, insulin secretion and testosterone, and by maintaining these insulin-sensitizing effects throughout pregnancy, MET-diet reduces the likelihood of developing GD, and prevents androgen excess for the fetus.",

      "abstract": "This post hoc analysis from the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) 2 trial reports on extended long-term outcome in relation to glucose-lowering agents in patients with myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomised as follows: group 1, insulin-based treatment; group 2, insulin during hospitalisation followed by conventional glucose control; and group 3, conventional treatment. Treatment according to the above protocol lasted 2.1 years. Using the total DIGAMI 2 cohort as an epidemiological database, this study presents mortality rates in the randomised groups, and mortality and morbidity rates by glucose-lowering treatment during an extended period of follow-up (median 4.1 and max 8.1 years). Follow-up data were available in 1,145 of the 1,253 patients. The mortality rate was 31% (72% cardiovascular) without significant differences between treatment groups. The total number of fatal malignancies was 37, with a trend towards a higher risk in group 1. The HR for death from malignant disease, compared with group 2, was 1.77 (95% CI 0.87-3.61; p = 0.11) and 3.60 (95% CI 1.24-10.50; p = 0.02) compared with group 3. Insulin treatment was associated with non-fatal cardiovascular events (OR 1.89 95% CI 1.35-2.63; p = 0.0002), but not with mortality (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93-1.81; p = 0.13). Metformin was associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p = 0.01) and a lower risk of death from malignancies (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.83; p = 0.02). Patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarction have a poor prognosis. Glucose-lowering drugs appear to be of prognostic importance. Insulin may be associated with an increased risk of non-fatal cardiac events, while metformin seems to be protective against risk of death.",

Metformin, Myoinositol and d-chiro-inositol acts as insulin sensitizers and exerts a beneficial effects in PCOS. The objective is to compare the effect of metformin monotherapy versus a combination of metformin with Myoinositol and d-chiro-inositol in PCOS. This study is a randomized controlled trial conducted over a period of 6 months. All overweight and obese women with PCOS with the age group between 18 and 35 were included and randomized into two groups, 27 in the metformin monotherapy arm and 26 in the myoinositol combination arm. The variables assessed were duration of menstrual cycle, anthropometric parameters, modified Ferriman Gallwey score, global acne score, Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, fasting lipid profile, serum testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, anti-Mullerian hormone, and pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian volume, PCOS Questionnaire score. Changes in the parameters from baseline at the end of 6 months of treatment were assessed and compared between the groups. Menstrual cycle regularity improved in both groups with significantly greater improvement in the group receiving myoinositol-based therapy (p < .001). Pregnancy rate was equal in both the arms. There was a significant improvement in PCOSQ score in myoinositol-based therapy group (p < .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in other hormonal, metabolic parameters between two groups in spite of symptomatic benefits. The addition of myoinositol to metformin exerts additional benefits in improving menstrual cycle regularity, and quality of life in women with PCOS.",

Insulin-sensitizer agents such as metformin and inositols have been shown to improve the endocrine and metabolic aspects of PCOS. The purpose of this study is to compare their effects on the clinical and metabolic features of the women with PCOS. Fifty PCOS women with IR and/or hyperinsulinemia were randomized to treatment with metformin (1500 mg/day) or myo-inositol (4 g/day). IR was defined as HOMA-IR >2.5, while hyperinsulinemia was defined as a value of AUC for insulin after a glucose load over the cutoff of our laboratory obtained in normal women. The Matsusa Index has been calculated. The women have been evaluated for insulin secretion, BMI, menstrual cycle length, acne and hirsutism, at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. The results obtained in both groups were similar. The insulin sensitivity improved in both treatment groups. The BMI significantly decreased and the menstrual cycle was normalized in about 50% of the women. No significant changes in acne and hirsutism were observed. The two insulin-sensitizers, metformin and myo-inositol, show to be useful in PCOS women in lowering BMI and ameliorating insulin sensitivity, and improving menstrual cycle without significant differences between the two treatments.",

      "abstract": "Does acupuncture improve insulin sensitivity more effectively than metformin or sham acupuncture in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance (IR)? Among women with PCOS and IR, acupuncture was not more effective than metformin or sham acupuncture in improving insulin sensitivity. Uncontrolled trials have shown that acupuncture improved insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects compared with metformin in women with PCOS and IR. However, data from randomized trials between acupuncture and metformin or sham acupuncture are lacking. This was a three-armed randomized controlled trial enrolling a total of 342 women with PCOS and IR from three hospitals between November 2015 and February 2018, with a 3-month follow-up until October 2018. Women aged from 18 to 40 years with PCOS and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥2.14 were randomly assigned (n = 114 per group) to receive true acupuncture plus placebo (true acupuncture), metformin plus sham acupuncture (metformin, 0.5 g three times daily) or sham acupuncture plus placebo (sham acupuncture) for 4 months, with an additional 3-month follow-up. True or sham acupuncture was given three times per week, and 0.5 g metformin or placebo was given three times daily. The primary outcome was change in HOMA-IR from baseline to 4 months after baseline visit. Secondary outcomes included changes in the glucose AUC during an oral glucose tolerance test, BMI and side effects at 4 months after baseline visit. After 4 months of treatment, the changes of HOMA-IR were -0.5 (decreased 14.7%) in the true acupuncture group, -1.0 (decreased 25.0%) in the metformin group and -0.3 (decreased 8.6%) in the sham acupuncture group, when compared with baseline. True acupuncture is not as effective as metformin in improving HOMA-IR at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1). No significant difference was found in change in HOMA-IR between true and sham acupuncture groups at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.3). During the 4 months of treatment, gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent in the metformin group, including diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting and stomach discomfort (31.6%, 13.2%, 11.4%, 8.8%, 14.0% and 8.8%, respectively). Bruising was more common in the true acupuncture group (14.9%). This study might have underestimated the sample size in the true acupuncture group with 4 months of treatment to enable detection of statistically significant changes in HOMA-IR with fixed acupuncture (i.e. a non-personalized protocol). Participants who withdrew because of pregnancy did not have further blood tests and this can introduce bias. True acupuncture did not improve insulin sensitivity as effectively as metformin in women with PCOS and IR, but it is better than metformin in improving glucose metabolism (which might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes) and has less side effects. Metformin had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects than acupuncture groups, and thus acupuncture might be a non-pharmacological treatment with low risk for women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture combined with metformin on insulin sensitivity in these women.

      "abstract": "To observe the effect of metformin (MET) monotherapy versus MET plus liraglutide (LIRA) on gonadal and metabolic profiles in overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Sixty overweight patients with PCOS were recruited from January 2021 to January 2022 in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University and were randomly assigned to the MET or combination (COM) group to receive 12 weeks of MET monotherapy or MET plus LIRA therapy. Anthropometric measurements, menstrual cycle changes, gonadal profiles, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted at baseline and after the 12-week treatment. Fifty-two subjects completed the trial while eight were lost during the follow-up. Both MET and COM improved menstrual cycles, anthropometric parameters, and glucose metabolism after the 12-week treatment; however, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. MET plus LIRA therapy improved hyperandrogenemia, including TT (total testosterone), SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) and FAI (free androgen index), whereas MET monotherapy only improved SHBG and FAI when compared with baseline. Furthermore, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved E2 (estradiol) while only MET plus LIRA therapy improved LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and Prog (progesterone) more effectively than baseline. Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy may improve TT, SHBG, FAI, LH and Prog more effectively than MET monotherapy; however, there were no significant differences on E2, FSH and LH/FSH between the two groups. In overweight patients with PCOS, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved glucose metabolism and relieved insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy was more effective than MET monotherapy in improving reproductive abnormalities and hyperandrogenemia, potentially by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-20% of women worldwide, with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia occurring in 50-70% of patients. Hyperinsulinemia exacerbates oxidative stress, contributing to PCOS pathogenesis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and insulin sensitizer that shows promise as a therapeutic for PCOS. Our current study aimed to investigate the effects of NAC supplementation on endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and its effect on ovulation induction (OI) efficacy in women with PCOS. Female C57BL/6 mice were orally administered letrozole (LE) to induce PCOS and then randomly divided into groups receiving daily oral administration of 160 mg/kg NAC (PCOS + NAC group), 200 mg/kg metformin (PCOS + Met group), or 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (drug solvent) (pure PCOS group) for 12 days. Healthy female mice served as pure controls. Estrous cycles were monitored during the intervention. Metabolic and hormone levels, ovarian phenotypes, antioxidant activity in ovarian tissues, and oxidative stress levels in oocytes were assessed post-intervention. Furthermore, a pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted with 230 PCOS women, randomly assigned to the NAC group (1.8 g/day oral NAC, n = 115) or the control group (n = 115). Patients in both groups underwent ≤ 3 cycles of OI with sequential LE and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (uFSH). Cycle characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups. Similar to metformin, NAC supplementation significantly improved the estrous cycles and ovarian phenotypes of PCOS mice; reduced the LH concentration, LH/FSH ratio, and T level; and increased glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity. Notably, NAC significantly reduced oocyte ROS levels and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in PCOS mice. Additionally, NAC significantly enhanced enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities in PCOS mouse ovaries, whereas metformin had no such effect. In the clinical trial, compared to women in the control group, women receiving NAC had significantly lower average uFSH dosage and duration (p < 0.005) and significantly greater clinical pregnancy rates per OI cycle and cumulative clinical pregnancy rates per patient (p < 0.005). NAC supplementation improved endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and significantly enhanced OI efficacy with sequential LE and uFSH in women with PCOS. Therefore, NAC could be a valuable adjuvant in OI for women with PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is frequently utilized in rheumatic immune disorders and has been discovered to exert hypoglycemic effects in some obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), however, the precise efficacy and mechanism of action remain ambiguous. To examine the impact of HCQ on glucose and lipid metabolism as well as sex hormone levels in obese women with PCOS. Fifty obese women with PCOS were randomly allocated into two groups: HCQ group (n = 25) and metformin (MET) group (n = 25). The HCQ group received a daily dose of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine, while the MET group received a daily dose of 1000 mg metformin. Body fat parameters, glucose and lipid metabolism levels, as well as hormone levels were evaluated. Additionally, the incidence of pregnancy within six months following treatment was also assessed. Network pharmacology was also employed to analyze the potential molecular mechanism. Patients in the HCQ group (n = 20) and MET group (n = 23) were ultimately included for analysis. Following treatment, both groups exhibited significant improvements in body fat distribution and glucose metabolism status, with the HCQ group demonstrating a notable advantage over the MET group in increasing insulin sensitivity index (ISI)(HCQ:1.87 ± 0.21,MET:1.75 ± 0.29). Serum lipid levels [Serum total cholesterol(TC, mmol/L)(HCQ:4.51 ± 0.87,MET:5.05 ± 0.65), triglyceride(TG, mmol/L)(HCQ:1.36 ± 0.51,MET:1.67 ± 0.72), low-density lipoprotein (LDL, mmol/L)(HCQ:2.66 ± 0.98,MET:0.47 ± 1.42),decreased in both groups post-treatment, with the HCQ group displaying clear advantages compared to the MET group. The improvement of sex hormone levels was not pronounced in either group, although there was an overall downward trend. The potential benefits of HCQ in the management of in obese women with PCOS include significant improvements in body fat distribution, glucose and lipid metabolism levels, as well as correction of hormonal disorders.

      "abstract": "The first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is lifestyle modification. However, it is currently unknown whether digital medicine can assist patients with PCOS in maintaining a healthy lifestyle while alleviating PCOS symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based digital intervention versus metformin treatment in women with PCOS and insulin resistance. A total of 80 women with PCOS and insulin resistance were recruited from an endocrinology clinic and randomly assigned to receive either a WeChat-based digital intervention (n=40, 50%) or metformin (n=40, 50%) for 12 weeks. The WeChat-based digital intervention consisted of 3 modules; a coach assisted the patients in using the intervention. The primary outcome was the change in a homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. At baseline and after the 12-week intervention, anthropometric parameters, menstruation frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic factors, and body fat distribution were measured in the clinic. Furthermore, self-assessed web-based questionnaires on diet, exercise, sleep, anxiety, and depression were obtained. A total of 72 participants completed the follow-up (for a 90% follow-up rate), including 35 of 40 (88%) participants from the digital intervention group and 37 of 40 (93%) participants from the metformin group. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance in the digital intervention group was significantly improved after 12 weeks of treatment with a mean change of -0.93 (95% CI -1.64 to -0.23), but no statistical difference was observed between the groups (least squares mean difference -0.20; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.58; P=.62). Both digital intervention and metformin treatment significantly improved menstruation frequency (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001) and reduced body weight (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001) and total fat mass (digital intervention: P<.001; metformin: P<.001). Furthermore, the digital intervention had a significant advantage over metformin in improving waist circumference (least squares mean difference -1.84; 95% CI -3.44 to -0.24; P=.03), waist-to-hip ratio (least squares mean difference -0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; P=.03), total fat mass (least squares mean difference -1.59; 95% CI -2.88 to -0.30; P=.02), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (least squares mean difference -69.73; 95% CI -129.70 to -9.75; P=.02). In terms of safety, the main adverse events were sensations of hunger in the digital intervention group (2/40, 5%) and gastrointestinal adverse events in the metformin group (12/40, 30%). Our data suggest that digital intervention is an effective treatment option for patients with PCOS, with an efficacy comparable to that of metformin, and that it can also alleviate the negative effects of medications and make it easier and more efficient to adhere to lifestyle treatments. WeChat-based digital interventions have the potential to provide a new path for the improvement and health of women with PCOS in China.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of Myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) with metformin in enhancing ovarian function, promoting ovulation, and reducing perceived stress in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS were identified using the Androgen Excess Society's criteria, and 60 participants were enrolled and divided equally into two groups. One group received a 40:1 ratio of MI plus DCI, while the other received metformin for a 12-week period. Endocrine and metabolic parameters, insulin-resistance, stress levels, and quality of life were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Both MI plus DCI and metformin significantly improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, p < 0.001), SHBG levels (p = 0.021), ovarian volume (p < 0.001), and menstrual regularity (p = 0.002), along with BMI, quality of life, and PSS scores (p < 0.001). Metformin showed slightly better outcomes in certain parameters, such as insulin sensitivity and endocrine markers, probably due to a higher representation of Phenotype A. In contrast, we hypothesize that MI plus DCI may be more effective for Phenotypes C and D. Our findings support both MI plus DCI and metformin as effective treatments for PCOS, with each treatment offering specific benefits. These results highlight the potential for a phenotype-specific tailored therapeutic approach to better manage the complex metabolic, endocrine, and stress-related challenges of PCOS.

Nevertheless, trials focused on SGLT-2 combination therapy's efficacy, and safety in PCOS patients are limited. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of CANA and metformin (MET) combination therapy and MET monotherapy in endocrine and metabolic profiles of overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Fifty-one overweight or obese non-diabetic PCOS women between 18 and 40 years old were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either CANA/MET or MET treatment. The CANA/MET group received CANA 100 mg once daily plus MET 1000 mg twice daily, while the MET group received MET 1000 mg twice daily for three months. Changes in menstrual pattern, anthropometric parameters, gonadal parameters, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Compared with the MET group, women have a significantly lower level of total testosterone (TT), area under the curve for glucose (AUCGlu), and area under the curve for insulin (AUCIns) to AUCGlu ratio in the combination group. There were no significant differences in menstrual frequency, body weight, body mass index, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, free androgen index, sex hormone-binding globulin, androstenedione, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, AUCIns, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and APO B/A1 ratio. AEs were seen in 57.70% (15/26) and 68.00% (17/25) of patients in the CANA/MET and MET groups, respectively. In overweight and obese women with PCOS, CANA and MET combination therapy may be similar to MET monotherapy in improving menstrual frequency, weight control, hyperandrogenemia, and relieving insulin resistance. CANA/MET may have more benefits in reducing TT, AUCGlu, and the AUCIns/AUCGlu ratio within three months than MET monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04973891.",

A total of 64 overweight/obese women with PCOS diagnosed <i>via</i> the Rotterdam criteria were randomly assigned to metformin(MET) 850 mg twice a day(BID) or combined MET 850 mg BID with beinaglutide (COMB) starting at 0.1mg three times a day(TID)and increasing to 0.2mg TID two weeks later. The main endpoints were changes in anthropometric measurements of obesity. Glucose and lipid metabolic, gonadal profiles, and antral follicle count changes as secondary outcomes were also observed. 60(93.75%) patients completed the study. In terms of lowering weight, body mass index (BMI),waist circumference(WC) and waist to height ratio(WHtR), COMB treatment outperformed MET monotherapy. Subjects in the COMB arm lost weight 4.54±3.16kg compared with a 2.47±3.59kg loss in the MET arm. In the COMB group, BMI,WC and WHtR were reduced significantly compared with that in the MET group, respectively. COMB therapy is also more favorable in the reduction of fasting insulin(FINS), total testosterone(TT), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR) when compared to MET therapy. Antral follicle count and ovarian volume were non-significantly changed in both groups.The most frequent side effects in both groups were mild and moderate digestive symptoms. Itching and induration at the injection site were reported with COMB treatment. Short-term combined treatment with beinaglutide and metformin appears superior to metformin monotherapy in lowering body weight, BMI, WC,WHtR and improving insulin sensitivity and androgen excess in women with PCOS and obesity, with tolerable adverse events. https://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx, identifier ChiCTR2000033741.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance plays a major role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of insulin sensitizer drugs in the treatment of PCOS. Research in recent years has shown that sitagliptin has been reported to improve ovarian cycles and ovulation in PCOS patients. We aimed to compare the effects of metformin and sitagliptin on PCOS individuals undergoing ICSI. Sixty PCOS patients were divided into 3 groups: metformin, sitagliptin, and placebo group. Treatment was carried out 2 months before the start of the ovulation cycle and continued until the day of oocyte aspiration. The serum levels of total testosterone, estradiol, and fasting insulin along with the total number of retrieved, normal and abnormal MII, and fertilized oocytes, the number of transferred embryos (grades I, II and III), and biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates as well as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were evaluated. There was a significant reduction in the serum levels of Insulin and total testosterone in the treated groups compared with the placebo. The number of mature and normal MII oocytes increased significantly in the treated groups compared with the placebo. Moreover, the number of immature oocytes decreased significantly and the number of grade I embryos increases significantly in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. We conclude that sitagliptin can improve the maturation of oocytes and embryos' quality more effectively than metformin, in PCOS patients undergoing ICSI. Trial registration is NCT04268563 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov ).",

      "abstract": "To determine the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in comparison to metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance (IR). A single-centre, prospective, randomized open-label (ratio 1:1) noninferiority trial was conducted at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, between July 2019 and April 2021. Women aged 18 to 45 years with PCOS and IR were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 100 mg (n = 33) canagliflozin daily or 1500 to 2000 mg metformin daily (n = 35) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric measurements, menstrual frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic variables and body fat distribution. For lowering of HOMA-IR after 12 weeks of treatment, canagliflozin was found to be noninferior to metformin (least-squares mean difference -0.81% [95% confidence interval -2.13 to 0.51]). Both canagliflozin and metformin significantly improved menstrual pattern, reduced body weight and total fat mass, and decreased triglyceride levels. Compared with metformin, canagliflozin had significant advantages in reducing uric acid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels. Pruritus vulvae (9.09%) and gastrointestinal reaction (55.55%) were the main adverse events in the metformin group and canagliflozin group, respectively. This study demonstrates that canagliflozin was not inferior to metformin in PCOS patients with IR, which suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors should be considered as effective drugs in the treatment of PCOS patients with IR.",

One hundred overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m2), average age 31 years, who were nonsmokers, were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and were off relevant medications for 3 months completed this 6-month open-label controlled trial. Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 microg ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 microg EE/100 microg levonorgestrel + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome measures were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function. All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance. In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, for which the insulin sensitizer metformin has been used therapeutically. It has been shown that curcumin also exhibits insulin-sensitizing properties. Given that metformin acts as an ovulation inducing agent and both curcumin and metformin can reduce insulin resistance, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of metformin with and without curcumin nanomicelles in the treatment of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This clinical trial was conducted on 100 women with PCOS, diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria, who were sequentially recruited and randomly divided into two groups (n = 50 each). Group 1 received 500 mg metformin three times daily and group 2 received 80 mg/day capsule of curcumin nanomicelle and 500 mg metformin three times a day for 3 months. After collecting fasting blood samples, biochemical parameters including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, plasma glucose, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were evaluated based on enzymatic methods. Hormonal parameters were assessed using immunoassay kits. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were also assessed. After treatment, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and total testosterone in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (p < 0.05). Post-treatment LDL-C levels in groups 1 and 2 were 117.9 ± 24 and 91.12 ± 19.46 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, HDL-C levels were increased with curcumin (group 1: 38.1 ± 4.36 mg/dL; group 2: 44.12 ± 7.3 mg/dL, p < 0.05). Total cholesterol was decreased with curcumin level (group 1: 207.9 ± 39.84 mg/dL; group 2; 159.7 ± 48.43 mg/dL, p < 0.05), with a decrease in triglycerides levels (group 1: 141.6 ± 9.57; group 2: 97.5 ± 8.8 mg/dL, p < 0.01). This study showed that curcumin has a synergistic effect with metformin in the improvement of insulin resistance and lipid profile in patients with PCOS. Therefore, the combined use of metformin and curcumin may have therapeutic utility in patients with PCOS.",

Less is known about inflammation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Thus we evaluated the impact of PCOS on circulating cytokine levels and the effects of anti-diabetic therapies on insulin action, cytokine and chemokine levels and inflammatory signaling in skeletal muscle. Twenty subjects with PCOS and 12 healthy normal cycling (NC) subjects of similar body mass index were studied. PCOS subjects received oral placebo or pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, for 6 months. All PCOS subjects then had metformin, 2 g/day, added to their treatment. Circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines, and adiponectin, skeletal muscle markers of inflammation and phosphorylation of signaling proteins, insulin action evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp procedure and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance were measured. Circulating levels of a number of cytokines and chemokines were generally similar between PCOS and NC subjects. Levels in PCOS subjects were not altered by pioglitazone or metformin treatment, even though whole body insulin action and adiponectin levels increased with pioglitazone. In spite of the lack of change in levels of cytokines and chemokines, several markers of inflammation in skeletal muscle were improved with Pio treatment. PCOS may represent a state of elevated sensitivity of inflammatory cells in skeletal muscle to cytokines and chemokines, a property that could be reversed by pioglitazone treatment together with improved insulin action.",

Forty-two infertile women with PCOS were selected in this randomized clinical study. Basal steroid and gonadotropin levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The patients were randomly divided into group 1 (n = 21) and group 2 (n = 21). Group 1 patients were treated with laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). Group 2 patients underwent laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) and received 1700 mg per day of metformin for 6 months. LOD was performed in women with PCOS using a unipolar electrode. Serum progesterone (P) level > 5 ng/mL was considered as a confirmation of ovulation. Ovulation and pregnancy rates were determined after six cycles. Serum androgens and insulin response to OGTT decreased significantly after metformin therapy. Mean serum P levels and endometrial thickness were significantly higher in cycles treated with metformin plus LOD (34.6 +/- 25.4 ng/mL, 8.4 +/- 1.1 mm) than in those treated with LOD alone (26.2 +/- 24.7 ng/mL, 7.9 +/- 2.8 mm) (P < 0.05). The ovulation (56 of 65 cycles, 86.1% vs 29 of 65 cycles, 44.6%) and pregnancy rates (nine of 21 women, 47.6% vs four of 21 women, 19.1%) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group I. Metformin improves insulin resistance, reduces androgen levels and significantly increases the ovulation and pregnancy rates in infertile women, following LOD.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, metformin is prescribed to improve pregnancy outcome in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metformin may also benefit future health by modulating increased metabolic stress during pregnancy. To investigate whether metformin during pregnancy modified future metabolic health in women with PCOS. Follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial that compared metformin with placebo in women with PCOS. Mean follow-up period was 7.7 years (range, 5 to 11 years). Three university hospitals, seven local hospitals, and one gynecological specialist practice. Women with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria; all former participants in the Metformin in Pregnant PCOS Women Study. Metformin 2000 mg daily or placebo from first trimester to delivery in the original study. No intervention in the present follow-up study. Main outcome measure was weight gain in the follow-up period. Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure (BP) were registered. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and fasting lipids, glucose, and insulin were analyzed. Of 239 invited women, 131 (55%) participated in the follow-up. Weight gain was similar in women given metformin (2.1 ± 10.5 kg) and women given placebo (1.8 ± 11.2 kg) at 7.7 years' follow-up after pregnancy (P = 0.834). No difference was found in BMI, waist/hip ratio, BP, body composition, lipids, glucose and insulin levels, or prevalence of metabolic syndrome at follow-up between those treated with metformin and those treated with placebo during pregnancy. Metformin treatment during pregnancy did not influence the metabolic profile in women with PCOS at 7.7 years of follow-up.",

Although recent studies have suggested that MANF appeared to be associated with insulin resistance, the results have been inconsistent. The aim of our study was to determine the serum MANF levels in women with PCOS and controls, to investigate their relationship to insulin resistance, and to evaluate circulating MANF changes with metformin intervention in PCOS women. We conducted a series of cross-sectional and interventional studies in 90 newly diagnosed patients with PCOS and 60 age- and gender-matched controls. Oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed to assess the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Forty-three women with PCOS were randomly assigned to six months of oral metformin therapy. Serum MANF levels were significantly lower in women with PCOS than in controls. Serum MANF levels were positively correlated with M-value and negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (FAT), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and free androgen index (FAI). Multivariate stepwise regression demonstrated that serum MANF levels were independently associated with M-value and FAI. After six months of metformin treatment, there was a significant increase in serum MANF levels in PCOS women. Serum MANF levels are decreased in women with PCOS, and are reversely related to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Metformin treatment elevates serum MANF levels and alleviates insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in PCOS women.",

This study aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the efficacy of metformin in improving insulin sensitivity among women with PCOS and IR. This is a retrospective analysis of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 114 women diagnosed with PCOS and IR. All women received metformin treatment for 4 months. We incorporated 27 baseline clinical variables of the women into the construction of our machine learning model. We firstly compared 4 commonly used feature selection methods to screen valuable clinical variables. Then we used the valuable variables as inputs to evaluate the performance of 5 machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, in predicting the efficacy of metformin. Among the 5 machine learning models, Support Vector Machine performed the best with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.781 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.772-0.791). The key predictive variables identified were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The developed machine learning model could be applied to predict the efficacy of metformin in improving insulin sensitivity among women with PCOS and IR. The result could help doctors evaluate the efficacy of metformin in advance, optimize treatment plans, and thereby enhance overall clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "To determine the longer-term effects of metformin treatment and behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We conducted a 3-parallel-arm, randomized trial. We enrolled overweight/obese adults who had been treated for solid tumors but had no ongoing cancer treatment and randomized them (<i>n</i> = 121) to either <i>1</i>) metformin (up to 2,000 mg), <i>2</i>) coach-directed behavioral weight loss, or <i>3</i>) self-directed care (control) for 12 months. We collected stool and serum at baseline (<i>n</i> = 114), 6 months (<i>n</i> = 109), and 12 months (<i>n</i> = 105). From stool, we extracted microbial DNA and conducted amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We measured SCFAs and other biochemical parameters from fasting serum. Of the 121 participants, 79% were female and 46% were Black, and the mean age was 60 years. Only metformin treatment significantly altered microbiota composition. Compared with control, metformin treatment increased amplicon sequence variants for <i>Escherichia</i> (confirmed as <i>Escherichia coli</i> by metagenomic sequencing) and <i>Ruminococcus torques</i> and decreased <i>Intestinibacter bartlettii</i> at both 6 and 12 months and decreased the genus <i>Roseburia</i>, including <i>R. faecis</i> and <i>R. intestinalis,</i> at 12 months. Effects were similar in comparison of the metformin group with the behavioral weight loss group. Metformin versus control also increased butyrate, acetate, and valerate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Behavioral weight loss versus control did not significantly alter microbiota composition but did increase acetate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Increases in acetate were associated with decreases in fasting insulin. Additional whole-genome metagenomic sequencing of a subset of the metformin group showed that metformin altered 62 metagenomic functional pathways, including an acetate-producing pathway and three pathways in glucose metabolism. Metformin, but not behavioral weight loss, impacted gut microbiota composition at 6 months and 12 months. Both metformin and behavioral weight loss altered circulating SCFAs at 6 months, including increasing acetate, which correlated with lower fasting insulin. Future research is needed to elucidate whether the gut microboime mediates or modifies metformin's health effects.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies on the impact of metformin and colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes have been limited by small size and confounding by indication, yielding inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to assess whether diabetes and pre-diagnostic metformin use influence CRC prognosis. The study was performed using the Colorectal Cancer Data Base Sweden, a register-linkage originating from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register with linkage to national health care registers and demographic registers. All adult patients diagnosed with primary non-metastatic CRC between 2007 and 2016, treated with curative surgery, were identified and followed up from 90 days post-surgery until December 31, 2022. Antidiabetic medication use was defined as dispensed prescription ≥6 months of use within 1 year of surgery. Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were divided into three treatment groups (i) diet only, (ii) metformin user, and (iii) non-metformin user. Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to recurrence, CRC-specific, and all-cause mortality, adjusted for relevant covariates. Of 33,028 non-metastatic CRC patients, 4539 (13.7%) had T2DM, with 1745 using metformin. A T2DM diagnosis was not associated with increased recurrence rate or CRC-specific mortality; HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.97 (95% CI 0.89-1.06) and HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.95 (95% CI 0.87-1.05), respectively, compared with non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, no association between T2DM, metformin use, and recurrence or CRC-specific mortality was seen, HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.98 (95% CI 0.86-1.12) and HR<sub>adj</sub> 0.98 (95% CI 0.85-1.13), respectively. T2DM is not associated with an elevated recurrence or CRC-specific mortality. Additionally, metformin use does not impact CRC prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Metformin, a biguanide commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been associated with potential beneficial effects across breast cancer subtypes in observational and preclinical studies. To determine whether the administration of adjuvant metformin (vs placebo) to patients with breast cancer without diabetes improves outcomes. MA.32, a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted in Canada, Switzerland, US, and UK, enrolled 3649 patients with high-risk nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving standard therapy between August 2010 and March 2013, with follow-up to October 2020. Patients were randomized (stratified for hormone receptor [estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor {ER/PgR}] status, positive vs negative; body mass index, ≤30 vs >30; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu], positive vs negative; and any vs no chemotherapy) to 850 mg of oral metformin twice a day (n = 1824) or oral placebo twice a day (n = 1825) for 5 years. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Of the 8 secondary outcomes, overall survival, distant relapse-free survival, and breast cancer-free interval were analyzed. Of the 3649 randomized patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 3643 women [99.8%]), all (100%) were included in analyses. After a second interim analysis, futility was declared for patients who were ER/PgR-, so the primary analysis was conducted for 2533 patients who were ER/PgR+. The median duration of follow-up in the ER/PgR+ group was 96.2 months (range, 0.2-121 months). Invasive disease-free survival events occurred in 465 patients who were ER/PgR+. The incidence rates for invasive disease-free survival events were 2.78 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 2.74 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21; P = .93), and the incidence rates for death were 1.46 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 1.32 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41; P = .47). Among patients who were ER/PgR-, followed up for a median of 94.1 months, incidence of invasive disease-free survival events was 3.58 vs 3.60 per 100 patient-years, respectively (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.30; P = .92). None of the 3 secondary outcomes analyzed in the ER/PgR+ group had statistically significant differences. Grade 3 nonhematological toxic events occurred more frequently in patients taking metformin than in patients taking placebo (21.5% vs 17.5%, respectively, P = .003). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the metformin vs placebo groups were hypertension (2.4% vs 1.9%), irregular menses (1.5% vs 1.4%), and diarrhea (1.9% vs 7.0%). Among patients with high-risk operable breast cancer without diabetes, the addition of metformin vs placebo to standard breast cancer treatment did not significantly improve invasive disease-free survival.

      "abstract": "We performed an exploratory analysis of the SPARTAN trial to determine whether concomitant exposure to several classes of commonly prescribed medications influenced the effect of apalutamide on overall survival (OS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). SPARTAN was a phase III randomized controlled trial in which nmCRPC patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive androgen deprivation therapy with or without apalutamide. We focused on 5 commonly prescribed classes of medications: metformin, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) based on a plausible biological and clinical rationale. To determine the potential effect modification, we applied multivariable Cox regression models for OS and MFS separately with additional interaction terms. To determine the independent association of concomitant medications with OS and MFS, we used IPTW-based log-rank test. A 2-sided p < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. We did not find statistically significant differences in effect from apalutamide on OS across subgroups stratified by concomitant exposure to any of the medication classes. While there was some difference in the treatment effect from apalutamide on MFS between patients with concomitant statins (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.20; 95 % CI: 0.15-0.28) versus without concomitant statins (aHR: 0.31 [0.24-0.39]), this did not reach the pre-specified threshold of statistical significance (p = 0.011). On IPTW-based analysis, patients treated concomitantly with metformin (median: not reached versus 31 months; p = 0.002), or ACEI (median: 37 versus 29 months, p = 0.006) had significantly improved MFS. In this post-hoc exploratory analysis of SPARTAN, effects of apalutamide on MFS and OS were consistent across subgroups stratified by exposure to concomitant medications. Exposure to concomitant metformin and ACEI was independently associated with a significant improvement in MFS.",

      "abstract": "High heterogeneity has been reported among cohort studies investigating the association between metformin and pancreatic cancer survival. Immortal time bias may be one importance source of heterogeneity, as it is widely present in previous cohort studies and may severely impair the validity. Our study aimed to examine whether metformin therapy improves pancreatic cancer survival, and to assess the impact of immortal time bias on the effect estimation of metformin in cohort studies. PubMed, EMbase and SciVerse Scopus were searched. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were derived using a random-effects model. Pooled RR from the six studies without immortal time bias showed no association between metformin and mortality in pancreatic cancer patients (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05; p = 0.22 and I<sup>2</sup> = 75%). In contrast, pooled RR from the nine studies with immortal time bias showed a reduction of 24% in mortality associated with metformin (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69, 0.84; p < 0.001 and I<sup>2</sup> = 1%). From a meta-regression model, existence of immortal time bias was associated with a reduction of 18% in the effect estimate of metformin on pancreatic cancer survival (ratio of RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70, 0.96; p = 0.02). In conclusions, cumulative evidence from cohort studies does not support a beneficial effect of metformin on pancreatic cancer survival. The association between metformin and pancreatic cancer survival has been greatly exaggerated in previous cohort studies due to the wide existence of immortal time bias. More rigorous designs and statistical methods are needed to account for immortal time bias.",

The study linked 22,324 LC patients from the Cancer Registry of Norway diagnosed 2005-2014 with the Norwegian Prescription Database. We estimated associations of pre- and post-diagnostic metformin use with overall survival (OS) and LC-specific survival (LCSS) using multivariable time-fixed and time-dependent Cox regression. Pre-diagnostic metformin use was not associated with improved survival in all patients. Nevertheless, pre-diagnostic metformin use was associated with better LCSS in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.99) and in patients with regional stage SCC (HR = 0.67; 95%CI 0.47-0.95). Post-diagnostic metformin use was associated with improved LCSS in all patients (HR = 0.83; 95%CI 0.73-0.95), in patients with SCC (HR = 0.75; 95%CI 0.57-0.98), regional stage LC (HR = 0.74; 95%CI 0.59-0.94), and regional stage SCC (HR = 0.57; 95%CI 0.38-0.86). OS showed similar results. Analyses of cumulative use showed a dose-response relationship in all patients, patients with adenocarcinoma and SCC, and with regional and metastatic LC. Metformin use was associated with improved survival, especially LCSS in patients with regional stage SCC. Further prospective studies are required to clarify the role of metformin in LC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients who failed antiviral therapy are at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study assessed the potential role of metformin and statins, medications for diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemia (HLP), in reducing HCC risk among these patients. We included CHC patients from the T-COACH study who failed antiviral therapy. We tracked the onset of HCC 1.5 years post-therapy by linking to Taiwan's cancer registry data from 2003 to 2019. We accounted for death and liver transplantation as competing risks and employed Gray's cumulative incidence and Cox subdistribution hazards models to analyze HCC development. Out of 2,779 patients, 480 (17.3%) developed HCC post-therapy. DM patients not using metformin had a 51% increased risk of HCC compared to non-DM patients, while HLP patients on statins had a 50% reduced risk compared to those without HLP. The 5-year HCC incidence was significantly higher for metformin non-users (16.5%) versus non-DM patients (11.3%; adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]=1.51; P=0.007) and metformin users (3.1%; aSHR=1.59; P=0.022). Statin use in HLP patients correlated with a lower HCC risk (3.8%) compared to non-HLP patients (12.5%; aSHR=0.50; P<0.001). Notably, the increased HCC risk associated with non-use of metformin was primarily seen in non-cirrhotic patients, whereas statins decreased HCC risk in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Metformin and statins may have a chemopreventive effect against HCC in CHC patients who failed antiviral therapy. These results support the need for personalized preventive strategies in managing HCC risk.",

      "abstract": "Metformin use has been associated with a decreased risk of some cancers, although data on head and neck cancer (HNC) are scarce. We explored the relation between the use of antidiabetic drugs and the risk of HNC. We conducted a case-control analysis in the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of people with incident HNC between 1995 and 2013 below the age of 90 years. Six controls per case were matched on age, sex, calendar time, general practice and number of years of active history in the CPRD prior to the index date. Other potential confounders including body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption and comorbidities were also evaluated. The final analyses were adjusted for BMI, smoking and diabetes mellitus (or diabetes duration in a sensitivity analysis). Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Use of metformin was neither associated with a statistically significant altered risk of HNC overall (1-29 prescriptions: adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61-1.24 and ≥ 30 prescriptions adjusted OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53-1.22), nor was long-term use of sulphonylureas (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59-1.30), or any insulin use (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.35). However, we found a (statistically non-significant) decreased risk of laryngeal cancer associated with long-term metformin use (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-1.03). In this population-based study, the use of antidiabetic drugs was not associated with a materially altered risk of HNC. Our data suggest a protective effect of long-term metformin use for laryngeal cancer.",

      "abstract": "To assess the association between metformin use and the risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a population at elevated risk for SSNHL. This cohort study utilized data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, following T2D patients from 2008 to 202 database's baseline. Metformin use was defined as achieving ≥80% of the medication possession ratio (MPR) and ≥28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD) within three months. The control group included patients with ≥80% MPR from other antidiabetic agents, ensuring active treatment comparability. Propensity score matching was applied to balance covariates, while competing risk models accounted for mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), incidence rates (IRs), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Metformin users demonstrated a lower SSNHL incidence (IR: 11.48 per 10,000 person-years) compared to non-users (IR: 15.66 per 10,000 person-years), with an IRR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82; p < 0.0001). Adjusted HRs indicated a 27% reduction in SSNHL risk (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.66-0.82). Higher cumulative doses (Q4: HR 0.36; 95% CI: 0.29-0.46) and daily doses ≥1 DDD (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87) were linked to further risk reductions. Metformin use was also associated with lower overall mortality. Metformin use is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in SSNHL risk and lower mortality in T2D patients. The rigorous definitions of metformin exposure and an actively treated comparator group emphasize these findings, suggesting metformin's potential role in SSNHL prevention and improved survival.",

With respect to kidney cancer scarce data are available. This study investigates whether metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) might affect kidney cancer risk. The reimbursement database of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan was used. T2DM patients aged ≥ 40 years and newly treated with either metformin (n=171,753, \"ever users of metformin\") or other antidiabetic drugs (n=75,499, \"never users of metformin\") within 1998-2002 were followed for at least 6 months for kidney cancer until 31 December 2009. The treatment effect was estimated by Cox regression using propensity score weighting by inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Hazard ratios were estimated for ever versus never users, and for tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy. During follow-up, 917 ever users and 824 never users developed kidney cancer, with respective incidence of 80.09 and 190.30 per 100,000 person-years. The hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for ever versus never users is 0.279 (0.254-0.307); and is 0.598 (0.535-0.668), 0.279 (0.243-0.321) and 0.104 (0.088-0.124), respectively, for the first, second, and third tertile of cumulative duration of <14.5, 14.5-45.8 and >45.8 months. In subgroup analyses, the lower risk of kidney cancer associated with metformin use is consistently observed in both sexes, and in patients with or without concomitant use of other antidiabetic drugs. Metformin use is associated with a decreased risk of kidney cancer in patients with T2DM.",

We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study to evaluate if post-diagnostic use of low-dose aspirin, statins, and metformin was associated with BC-specific survival. Women aged ≥ 50 years and diagnosed with BC in 2004-2017, who survived ≥ 12 months after diagnosis (follow-up started 12 months after diagnosis), were identified in the Cancer Registry of Norway. The Norwegian Prescription Database provided information on prescriptions. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between post-diagnostic use and BC-specific survival, overall and by oestrogen receptor (ER) status. A total of 26,190 patients were included. Of these, 5324 (20%), 7591 (29%), and 1495 (6%) were post-diagnostic users of low-dose aspirin, statins, and metformin, respectively. The median follow-up was 6.1 years, and 2169 (8%) patients died from BC. HRs for use, compared to no use, were estimated at 0.96 (95% CI 0.85-1.08) for low-dose aspirin (ER+: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.83-1.13; ER-: HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.29, p value for interaction = 0.562), 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.94) for statins (ER+: HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.09; ER-: HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-1.00, p value for interaction = 0.259), and 0.70 (95% CI 0.51-0.96) for metformin (compared to use of non-metformin antidiabetics) (ER+: HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-1.01; ER-: HR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.72-3.62, p value for interaction = 0.077). We found evidence supporting an association between post-diagnostic use of statins and metformin and survival, in patients with BC. Our findings indicate potential differences according to ER status.",

A sample of 15414 never users and 280159 ever users of metformin (original sample) and a 1:1 matched-pairs of ever and never users (n=15414 in each group, matched sample) were recruited from patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus during 1999-2005. They were followed until December 31, 2011. Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score was used to estimate hazard ratios. Results showed that the respective incidence of lung cancer in ever and never users was 173.36 and 292.65 per 100000 person-years in the original sample; and was 211.71 and 292.65, respectively, in the matched sample. The overall hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.586 (0.509-0.674) in the original sample and 0.717 (0.584-0.881) in the matched sample suggested a significantly lower risk among metformin users. Hazard ratios comparing the first (<22.60 months), second (22.60-46.67 months) and third (>46.67 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin use to never users was 1.163 (1.005-1.348), 0.612 (0.526-0.711) and 0.176 (0.148-0.210), respectively, in the original sample; and was 1.465 (1.131-1.897), 0.758 (0.566-1.016) and 0.228 (1.460-0.357) in the respective tertile of the matched sample. Sensitivity analyses after excluding patients with certain risk factors of cancer and subgroup analyses supported a favorable effect of metformin. In conclusion,metformin use may reduce lung cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence for the association between postdiagnostic metformin use and survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited. Using the Taiwan Cancer Registry database, a cohort of 16,676 diabetic patients newly diagnosed with CRC from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2014, followed until December 31, 2016, was identified. Postdiagnostic use of metformin (two or more prescriptions after CRC diagnosis) was defined as a time-dependent covariate with 6-month lag. Multivariate Cox regression model and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate adjusted effects of metformin on all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality during follow-up. A number of 11,438 (69%) received metformin after CRC diagnosis. Overall, 7,393 deaths, including 4,845 CRC-specific deaths, were observed during 64,322 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, metformin users had lower all-cause mortality than did nonusers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.44) and lower CRC-specific mortality (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.39-0.44). Similar but somewhat attenuated effects were observed after stabilized IPTW (HR for all-cause mortality, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.53-0.59; HR for CRC-specific mortality, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.55-0.61). Similar results were observed in stratified analyses of 2,112 patients with no prediagnostic metformin use and 14,564 patients with prediagnostic metformin use. Findings for both outcomes were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. Use of postdiagnostic metformin was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality, regardless of prior metformin use. These findings support the use of metformin as an adjunct to standard care of diabetic patients with CRC.",

      "abstract": "Metformin has been linked to improve survival of patients with various cancers. There is little information on survival of glioblastoma patients after use of metformin. We assessed the association between metformin use and survival in a pooled analysis of patient data from 1,731 individuals from the randomized AVAglio, CENTRIC and CORE trials. We performed multivariate Cox analyses for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) comparing patients' use of metformin at baseline and/or during concomitant radiochemotherapy (TMZ/RT). Further exploratory analyses investigated the effect of metformin with a history of diabetes and nonfasting glucose levels in relation to OS or PFS of glioblastoma patients. Metformin alone or in any combination was not significantly associated with OS or PFS (at baseline, hazard ratio [HR] for OS = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65-1.16; HR for PFS = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.64-1.10; during TMZ/RT HR for OS = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.68-1.38; HR for PFS = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.74-1.41). We found a statistically nonsignificant association of metformin monotherapy with glioblastoma survival at baseline (HR for OS = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.42-1.10; HR for PFS = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.91), but not during the TMZ/RT period (HR for OS = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.51-1.56; HR for PFS = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.64-1.73). Diabetes mellitus or increased nonfasting glucose levels were not associated with a difference in OS or PFS in our selected study population. Metformin did not prolong survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in our analysis. Additional studies may identify patients with specific tumor characteristics that are associated with potential benefit from treatment with metformin, possibly due to metabolic vulnerabilities.",

Therapies that reduce IGF-1 have considerable appeal as means to prevent recurrence. Randomized, 3-parallel-arm controlled clinical trial. Cancer survivors with overweight or obesity were randomized to (1) self-directed weight loss (comparison), (2) coach-directed weight loss, or (3) metformin treatment. Main outcomes were changes in IGF-1 and IGF-1:IGFBP3 molar ratio at 6 months. The trial duration was 12 months. Of the 121 randomized participants, 79% were women, 46% were African Americans, and the mean age was 60 years. At baseline, the average body mass index was 35 kg/m2; mean IGF-1 was 72.9 (SD, 21.7) ng/mL; and mean IGF1:IGFBP3 molar ratio was 0.17 (SD, 0.05). At 6 months, weight changes were -1.0% (P = 0.07), -4.2% (P < 0.0001), and -2.8% (P < 0.0001) in self-directed, coach-directed, and metformin groups, respectively. Compared with the self-directed group, participants in metformin had significant decreases on IGF-1 (mean difference in change: -5.50 ng/mL, P = 0.02) and IGF1:IGFBP3 molar ratio (mean difference in change: -0.0119, P = 0.011) at 3 months. The significant decrease of IGF-1 remained in participants with obesity at 6 months (mean difference in change: -7.2 ng/mL; 95% CI: -13.3 to -1.1), but not in participants with overweight (P for interaction = 0.045). There were no significant differences in changes between the coach-directed and self-directed groups. There were no differences in outcomes at 12 months. In cancer survivors with obesity, metformin may have a short-term effect on IGF-1 reduction that wanes over time.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of metformin and weight loss on biomarkers associated with breast cancer prognosis. Overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 333) were randomly assigned to metformin vs placebo and to a weight loss intervention vs control (ie, usual care). The 2 × 2 factorial design allows a single randomized trial to investigate the effect of two factors and interactions between them. Outcomes were changes in fasting insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), estradiol, testosterone, and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The trial was powered for a main effects analysis of metformin vs placebo and weight loss vs control. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. A total of 313 women (94.0%) completed the six-month trial. High prescription adherence (ie, ≥80% of pills taken) ranged from 65.9% of participants in the metformin group to 81.3% of those in the placebo group (P < .002). Mean percent weight loss was statistically significantly higher in the weight loss group (-5.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -6.3% to -4.8%) compared with the control group (-2.7%, 95% CI = -3.5% to -1.9%). Statistically significant group differences (ie, percent change in metformin group minus placebo group) were -7.9% (95% CI = -15.0% to -0.8%) for insulin, -10.0% (95% CI = -18.5% to -1.5%) for estradiol, -9.5% (95% CI = -15.2% to -3.8%) for testosterone, and 7.5% (95% CI = 2.4% to 12.6%) for SHBG. Statistically significant group differences (ie, percent change in weight loss group minus placebo group) were -12.5% (95% CI = -19.6% to -5.3%) for insulin and 5.3% (95% CI = 0.2% to 10.4%) for SHBG. As adjuvant therapy, weight loss and metformin were found to be a safe combination strategy that modestly lowered estrogen levels and advantageously affected other biomarkers thought to be on the pathway for reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with increased breast cancer risk, but commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications such as metformin may reduce risk. Few studies have investigated T2D and medications together in relation to breast cancer. Data came from 44 541 Sister Study participants aged 35 to 74 years at enrollment (2003-2009) who satisfied eligibility criteria, followed through 15 September 2017. Information on time-varying, self-reported, physician-diagnosed, prevalent and incident T2D, use of antidiabetic medications, and covariates was obtained from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Incident breast cancers were confirmed with medical records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. During follow-up (median, 8.6 years), 2678 breast cancers were diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment. There were 3227 women (7.2%) with prevalent and 2389 (5.3%) with incident T2D, among whom 61% (n = 3386) were ever treated with metformin. There was no overall association between T2D and breast cancer risk (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.13). However, T2D was associated with increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90-2.16). Compared with not having T2D, T2D with metformin use was not associated with overall breast cancer risk (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15), but it was associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.05) and increased risk of ER-negative (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.88) and triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.06-2.83). The inverse association with ER-positive cancer was stronger for longer duration (≥10 year) metformin use (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.01; P for trend = 0.09). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggest that associations between T2D and breast cancer may differ by hormone receptor status and that associations between T2D and ER-positive breast cancer may be reduced by long-term metformin use.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and increased risk of pregnancy complications. Metformin treatment reduces the risk of late miscarriage and preterm birth in pregnant women with PCOS. Whether the protective effect of metformin involves immunological changes has not been determined. To investigate the effect of metformin on the maternal immunological status in women with PCOS. A post-hoc analysis was performed of two randomized controlled trials, PregMet and PregMet2, including longitudinal maternal serum samples from 615 women with PCOS. Women were randomized to metformin or placebo from first trimester to delivery. Twenty-two cytokines and C-reactive protein were measured in serum sampled at gestational weeks 5 to 12, 19, 32, and 36. Metformin treatment was associated with higher serum levels of several multifunctional cytokines throughout pregnancy, with the strongest effect on eotaxin (P < .001), interleukin-17 (P = .03), and basic fibroblast growth factor (P = .04). Assessment of the combined cytokine development confirmed the impact of metformin on half of the 22 cytokines. The immunomodulating effect of metformin was more potent in normal weight and overweight women than in obese women. Moreover, normoandrogenic women had the strongest effect of metformin in early pregnancy, whereas hyperandrogenic women presented increasing effect throughout pregnancy. It appears that metformin has immunomodulating rather than anti-inflammatory properties in pregnancy. Its effect on the serum levels of many multifunctional cytokines demonstrates robust, persisting, and body mass-dependent immune mobilization in pregnant women with PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Pre-clinical studies suggest that metformin and statins may delay prostate cancer (PCa) metastases; however, data in humans are limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first human study aimed to quantify the individual and joint effects of statin and metformin use among patients with high-risk PCa. This population-based retrospective cohort study identified patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare Prescription Drug Event files. The association with all-cause and PCa mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model with competing causes of death, where propensity scores were used to adjusted imbalances in covariates across groups. Based on 12 700 patients with high-risk PCa, statin alone or in combination with metformin was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.96; and HR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83, respectively) and PCa mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.92) and 0.64; 95% CI, d 0.51-0.81, respectively. The effects were more pronounced in post-diagnostic users: combination use of metformin/statins was associated with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.57-0.80), and 54% reduction in PCa mortality (95% CI, 0.30-0.69). No significant association of metformin alone was observed with either all-cause mortality or PCa mortality. Statin use alone or in combination with metformin was associated with lower all-cause and PCa mortality among high-risk patients, particularly in post-diagnostic settings; further studies are warranted.",

These exposure groups were then followed forward in time (from diagnosis until death or study end, 2008–2014) to compare the incidence of the primary outcomes: all-cause mortality and PCa mortality. This methodology aligns precisely with the criteria for a cohort study, where groups defined by exposure are compared regarding subsequent outcome development."

The patients were excluded if they had type I diabetes mellitus and a history of other cancers. Results: Of 1,262 EC patients in the study period, there was 212 (16.8%) patients who met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 90 (42.5%) were non-metformin users and 122 (57.5%) were metformin users. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the 5-year overall survivals (76.4% vs 77.9%, p=0.959) and the 5-year progression-free survivals (92.6% vs 84.7%, p=0.091) did not significantly differ between the both groups. On Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were FIGO stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and cervical involvement. Patients with non-endometrioid histology and advanced stage were found to have a significant effect on progression-free survival (PFS). However, metformin used did not predict either OS (HR, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.56-1.73; p=0.959) or PFS (HR, 2.19; 95%CI, 0.86-5.55; p=0.099). Conclusion: Overall, a significant effect of metformin on survival outcomes in EC patients with diabetes was not found in the current study. Larger studies with a prospective randomized control design are needed to clarify the benefit of metformin as a strategy for endometrial cancer prevention and treatment.",

In 143,035 men (≥ 65 yrs old) of SEER-Medicare 2007-2015, we identified White (N = 110,430), Black (N = 13,520) and Other Race (N = 19,085) men diagnosed with incident HRC. Pre-diagnostic prescription of metformin and TTh was ascertained for this analysis. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were conducted. We found independent and joint associations of metformin and TTh with incident prostate (odds ratio [OR]<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.54) and colorectal cancers (OR<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64), but not with male breast cancer. There were also inversed joint associations of metformin and TTh with HRCs (OR<sub>joint</sub>  = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38-0.54). Similar reduced associations with HRCs were identified among White, Black, and Other Race men. Pre-diagnostic use of metformin and TTh were, independently and jointly, inversely associated with incident prostate and colorectal cancers. The risk of HRCs was also reduced among White, Black and Other Race men. Greatest reduced associations of prostate and colorectal cancers and HRCs were mainly observed in combination of metformin and TTh. Larger studies are needed to confirm the independent and joint association of metformin plus TTh with these cancers in understudied and underserved populations.",

New primary invasive cancers (outside the ipsilateral breast) developing as a first event were identified. Time to events was described by the competing risks method; two-sided likelihood ratio tests adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol intake were used to compare metformin versus placebo arms.

Previous epidemiological studies however have been limited by small sample sizes and certain time-related biases. This study aimed to investigate whether colorectal cancer patients with type 2 diabetes who were exposed to metformin had reduced cancer-specific mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,197 colorectal cancer patients newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2009 (identified from English cancer registries) with type 2 diabetes (based upon Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD, prescription and diagnosis records). In this cohort 382 colorectal cancer-specific deaths occurred up to 2012 from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data. Metformin use was identified from CPRD prescription records. Using time-dependent Cox regression models, unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were calculated for the association between post-diagnostic exposure to metformin and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Overall, there was no evidence of an association between metformin use and cancer-specific death before or after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80, 1.40). In addition, after adjustment for confounders, there was also no evidence of associations between other diabetic medications and cancer-specific mortality including sulfonylureas (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86, 1.51), insulin use (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.95, 1.93) or other anti-diabetic medications including thiazolidinediones (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46, 1.14). Similar associations were observed by duration of use and for all-cause mortality. This population-based study, the largest to date, does not support a protective association between metformin and survival in colorectal cancer patients.",

Use of metformin and other medications before diagnosis and medical condition histories were assessed using administrative databases. We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for use of metformin, adjusting for confounders.<b>Results:</b> Risk of total NHLs is not associated with ever use of metformin (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.10) among diabetic patients. NHL subtypes were also not associated with metformin use.<b>Conclusions:</b> Metformin use is not associated with overall or subtype NHL risk among diabetic patients.<b>Impact:</b> NHLs are etiologically heterogeneous and larger scale studies are warranted to test the potential effect of metformin by NHL subtype. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(5); 610-2. ©2018 AACR</i>.",

      "abstract": "Observational studies report that physical activity and metformin are associated with improved clinical outcome in patients with cancer. Inflammation is one biological mechanism hypothesized to mediate these associations. In this phase II, multicenter, 2 × 2 factorial trial, 139 patients with breast and colorectal cancer who completed standard therapy were randomized to one of four treatment groups for 12 weeks: exercise alone, metformin alone, exercise and metformin, or control. Inflammation outcomes included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor two (sTNFαR2), and IL6. The primary modeling strategy evaluated the trial product estimand that was quantified using a generalized linear mixed model. Compared with control, exercise alone reduced hs-CRP [-30.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -50.3, -1.0] and IL6 (-30.9%; 95% CI, -47.3, -9.5) but did not change sTNFαR2 (1.0%; 95% CI, -10.4, 13.9). Compared with control, metformin alone did not change hs-CRP (-13.9%; 95% CI, -40.0, 23.4), sTNFαR2 (-10.4%; 95% CI, -21.3, 2.0), or IL6 (-22.9%; 95% CI, -42.3, 2.0). Compared with control, exercise and metformin reduced sTNFαR2 (-13.1%; 95% CI, -22.9, -1.0) and IL6 (-38.7%; 95% CI, -52.3, -18.9) but did not change hs-CRP (-20.5%; 95% CI, -44.0, 12.7). The combination of exercise and metformin was not synergistic for hs-CRP, sTNFαR2, or IL6. In survivors of breast and colorectal cancer with low baseline physical activity and without type 2 diabetes, exercise and metformin reduced measures of inflammation that are associated with cancer recurrence and mortality.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with pleural or unspecified mesothelioma between 1993 and 2014 using linked Scottish population-based diabetes and cancer datasets. Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to describe the association between use of metformin and all-cause mortality following diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma. There were 300 people with type 2 diabetes and pleural or unspecified mesothelioma of whom 148 had ever used metformin and 290 died during follow up. The median survival time was 8.8 months and 6.5 months for metformin users and non-users respectively (p=0.37, log-rank test). After adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, socio-economic status, and other anti-diabetic medications the hazard ratio for mortality associated with metformin was 0.99 (95% confidence intervals: 0.76-1.28; p=0.92). Similar non-statistically significant associations were obtained in sensitivity analyses based on metformin use in year prior to diagnosis of mesothelioma, use of metformin for more than one year, in people below the mean age at diagnosis of mesothelioma (74 years) and 74 years of age or older, limitation to pleural mesothelioma and following further adjustment for body mass index and smoking. There was no evidence that metformin improved survival among people with type 2 diabetes and pleural mesothelioma or to support trials of metformin in people with mesothelioma.",

To investigate risk and protective factors associated with the occurrence of ampullary tumors and whether these factors differ between ampullary tumors of the intestinal and pancreatobiliary subtypes or between adenomas and carcinomas. The association between a large set of exposome features and ampullary tumors occurrence was investigated in a bi-centric case-control study after ethic committee approval and power calculation. In 223 histologically confirmed patients and 446 controls, previous cholecystectomy (odd ratio [OR] = 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-3.20) and proton pump inhibitors use (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.16-2.37) were associated with increased risk of ampullary tumors, aspirin use (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.90) and light alcohol intake (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.38-0.76) with reduced risk. A previous cholecystectomy was also associated with tumors of intestinal subtype and with both adenomas and carcinomas, and proton pump inhibitors use with adenomas only. Smoking, body mass index, family history of cancers, previous ulcer, diabetes and use of statins, insulin and metformin were not significant factors. This is the first case-control study specifically highlighting factors associated with the occurrence of ampullary tumors. We report factors that are novel and plausible, in keeping with mechanisms described for other gastrointestinal tumors and with potential clinical relevance.",

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of diabetes and diabetes medications on risk of second breast cancer events (SBCE) and mortality. This population-based cohort study was conducted among women diagnosed with early-stage (I-II) BC and enrolled in an integrated health plan. Exposures of interest were diabetes and medication classes including insulin, metformin, and sulfonylureas. Outcomes of interest were SBCE defined as recurrence or second primary BC, BC-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for diabetes and medication use while accounting for potential confounders and competing risks. Among 4,216 women, 13 % developed SBCE during a median follow-up of 6.3 years. 610 women had diabetes of which 76 % used oral diabetes medication and/or insulin. Findings suggested that diabetes increased the risk of recurrence (HR = 1.57; 95 % CI 1.09-2.25) but not overall SBCE (HR = 1.29; 95 % CI 0.94-1.76) or second primary BC (HR = 0.74; 95 % CI 0.39-1.41). Among women with diabetes, insulin use was associated with increased risks of recurrence (HR = 1.94; 95 % CI 1.08-3.48) and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.33; 95 % CI 1.70-3.20). Metformin use was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.38-0.79). Our findings show an association between diabetes and increased recurrence risk, and risk may be greater among insulin users. Metformin may reduce all-cause mortality among BC survivors. Given the growing breast cancer survivor population, further research in larger, more diverse populations is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDEpidemiologic studies suggest that metformin has antitumor effects. Laboratory studies indicate metformin impacts cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). As part of a phase II trial, we evaluated the impact of metformin on CSC number and on carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs) and clinical outcomes in nondiabetic patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).METHODSThirty-eight patients with stage IIC (n = 1)/III (n = 25)/IV (n = 12) EOC were treated with either (a) neoadjuvant metformin, debulking surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy plus metformin or (b) neoadjuvant chemotherapy and metformin, interval debulking surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy plus metformin. Metformin-treated tumors, compared with historical controls, were evaluated for CSC number and chemotherapy response. Primary endpoints were (a) a 2-fold or greater reduction in aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) CD133+ CSCs and (b) a relapse-free survival at 18 months of more than 50%.RESULTSMetformin was well tolerated. Median progression-free survival was 18.0 months (95% CI 14.0-21.6) with relapse-free survival at 18 months of 59.3% (95% CI 38.6-70.5). Median overall survival was 57.9 months (95% CI 28.0-not estimable). Tumors treated with metformin had a 2.4-fold decrease in ALDH+CD133+ CSCs and increased sensitivity to cisplatin ex vivo. Furthermore, metformin altered the methylation signature in CA-MSCs, which prevented CA-MSC-driven chemoresistance in vitro.CONCLUSIONTranslational studies confirm an impact of metformin on EOC CSCs and suggest epigenetic change in the tumor stroma may drive the platinum sensitivity ex vivo. Consistent with this, metformin therapy was associated with better-than-expected overall survival, supporting the use of metformin in phase III studies.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT01579812.",

Previous studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients taking metformin suffering from prostate, colon, lung, thyroid, and esophageal cancers. Metformin's main antineoplastic mechanism of action is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha, and activation of p53. We investigated the overall survival of type 2 diabetic patients on metformin with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma using the Computerized Patient Record System at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis TN. Lymphoma and pancreatic cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were sorted into an experimental (metformin) group and a control (nonmetformin) group. Patients were compared on baseline characteristics including race, body mass index, and age. Cancer outcomes including overall survival, metastasis, recurrences, and incidence of new malignancies were recorded. Hemoglobin A1C, creatinine and cancer treatment modalities were recorded and compared. Statistical analyses used included unpaired t tests and Chi-squared tests. There was significantly greater overall long-term survival in the metformin group compared to the nonmetformin group for lymphoma (5.89 vs 1.29 years, P < 0.001) and for pancreatic cancer (0.68 vs 0.22 years, P = 0.016). Cancer treatment modalities in both groups were comparable. Metformin is associated with a significant, positive effect of increased overall survival in type 2 diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma. These results are encouraging, and prospective studies should be done to further investigate metformin's effects in cancer.",

Statins and metformin have received considerable interest as potential chemopreventive agents against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, their impact on overall survival of patients with T2DM who later develop HCC (diabetic HCC patients) is unclear. Data on 2499 elderly diabetic HCC patients obtained from the SEER-Medicare program (2009 to 2013) were analyzed. Patients were categorized based on use of statins only, metformin only, both, or neither (reference for all comparisons). The patients were further categorized based on: (1) metformin dose: ≤1500 or >1500 mg/d; (2) statins functional form: hydrophilic (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) or lipophilic (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin); (3) statins potency: high (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) or low (fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin); and (4) individual statins type. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Prediagnosis use of metformin dose ≤1500 mg/d was associated with lower risk of death after HCC diagnosis in patients with T2DM (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), adjusting for postdiagnosis metformin dose, diabetes severity, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor characteristics, and other relevant factors. No association was found for prediagnosis metformin dose >1500 mg/d or postdiagnosis metformin use. Further, no association was found for either prediagnosis or postdiagnosis statins use. Prediagnosis use of metformin dose ≤1500 mg/d is associated with longer overall survival of elderly diabetic HCC patients.",

      "abstract": "The effect of metformin on leukemia risk remains unknown. The Taiwan's National Health Insurance database was used to enroll 610,089 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients on at least 2 anti-diabetic prescriptions during 1999-2009. We followed-up these patients until 31 December 2011, in order to determine the incidence of leukemia. We used Cox regression model (incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment-weighting using propensity scores) to estimate hazard ratios in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We enrolled 414,783 metformin initiators and 195,306 non-metformin initiators. Among them, 598 and 372 patients developed new-onset leukemia after a median follow-up period of 5.08 years and 6.79 years, respectively. The respective incidence rates were 26.52 and 28.40 per 100,000 person-years. The hazard ratio for metformin initiators versus non-metformin initiators was 0.943 (95% confidence interval 0.828-1.074) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.852 (95% confidence interval 0.705-1.031) in the per-protocol analysis. Sensitivity analyses after excluding patients using the exclusion criteria (a follow-up duration < 24 and < 36 months, respectively, patients with incretin-based therapies during follow-up, and patients enrolled during 2 different periods of 1999-2003 and 2004-2009) consistently showed a neutral effect. However, metformin initiators had a significantly higher risk of leukemia in the per-protocol analyses when censoring patients at a time without regular follow-up. Metformin use has an overall neutral effect on leukemia but we cannot exclude a significantly higher risk in patients who persistently use the drug.",

Male participants were from Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (Australia) recruited between 2006 and 2009. Questionnaire and linked administrative health data from the Centre for Health Record Linkage and Services Australia were used to identify incident PC, healthcare utilisations, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing reimbursements and dispensing of metformin and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) prescriptions. Multivariable Cox and Joint Cox regression analyses were used to examine associations by cancer spread, adjusting for various confounders. Of 107,706 eligible men, 4257 developed incident PC up to end 2013. Risk of PC diagnosis increased with: PC family history (versus no family history of cancer; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.36; 95% CI:1.21-1.52); father and brother(s) diagnosed with PC (versus cancer-free family history; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 2.20; 95% CI:1.61-2.99); severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms (versus mild; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.77; 95% CI:1.53-2.04) and vasectomy (versus none; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.08; 95% CI:1.00-1.16). PC risk decreased with dispensed prescriptions (versus none) for BPH (HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.76; 95% CI:0.69-0.85) and metformin (HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.57; 95% CI:0.48-0.68). Advanced PC risk increased with vasectomy (HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.28; 95% CI:1.06-1.55) and being obese (versus normal weight; HR<sub>adjusted</sub> = 1.31; 95% CI:1.01-1.69). Vasectomy and obesity are associated with an increased risk of advanced PC. The reduced risk of localised and advanced PC associated with BPH, and diabetes prescriptions warrants investigation.",

Based on retrospective case-control pharmacoepidemiologic analyses of insurance claims data for 7.23 million individuals, we found that sildenafil usage was significantly associated with a 69% reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.39, P<1.0×10<sup>-8</sup>). Propensity score stratified analyses confirmed that sildenafil is significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD across all four drug cohorts we tested (diltiazem, glimepiride, losartan and metformin) after adjusting age, sex, race, and disease comorbidities. We also found that sildenafil increases neurite growth and decreases phospho-tau expression in AD patient-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neuron models, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease. The association between sildenafil use and decreased incidence of AD does not establish causality or its direction, which requires a randomized clinical trial approach.",

The mechanism appears to be suppression of protein translation via targeting the host mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. In the COVID-OUT randomized trial for outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), metformin reduced the odds of hospitalizations/death through 28 days by 58%, of emergency department visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days by 42%, and of long COVID through 10 months by 42%. COVID-OUT was a 2 × 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin; 999 participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs on day 1 (n = 945), day 5 (n = 871), and day 10 (n = 775). Viral load was quantified using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.05 to -.06; P = .027). Those who received metformin were less likely to have a detectable viral load than placebo at day 5 or day 10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, .55 to .94). Viral rebound, defined as a higher viral load at day 10 than day 5, was less frequent with metformin (3.28%) than placebo (5.95%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .36 to 1.29). The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and increased over time. Neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed effect over placebo. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2, metformin significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which may explain the clinical benefits in this trial. Metformin is pleiotropic with other actions that are relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology. NCT04510194.",

      "abstract": "Post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is an emerging chronic illness potentially affecting millions of people. We aimed to evaluate whether outpatient COVID-19 treatment with metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce the risk of long COVID. We conducted a decentralised, randomised, quadruple-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial (COVID-OUT) at six sites in the USA. We included adults aged 30-85 years with overweight or obesity who had COVID-19 symptoms for fewer than 7 days and a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR or antigen test within 3 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned via 2 × 3 parallel factorial randomisation (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive metformin plus ivermectin, metformin plus fluvoxamine, metformin plus placebo, ivermectin plus placebo, fluvoxamine plus placebo, or placebo plus placebo. Participants, investigators, care providers, and outcomes assessors were masked to study group assignment. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 by day 14, and those data have been published previously. Because the trial was delivered remotely nationwide, the a priori primary sample was a modified intention-to-treat sample, meaning that participants who did not receive any dose of study treatment were excluded. Long COVID diagnosis by a medical provider was a prespecified, long-term secondary outcome. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04510194. Between Dec 30, 2020, and Jan 28, 2022, 6602 people were assessed for eligibility and 1431 were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 1323 participants who received a dose of study treatment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, 1126 consented for long-term follow-up and completed at least one survey after the assessment for long COVID at day 180 (564 received metformin and 562 received matched placebo; a subset of participants in the metformin vs placebo trial were also randomly assigned to receive ivermectin or fluvoxamine). 1074 (95%) of 1126 participants completed at least 9 months of follow-up. 632 (56·1%) of 1126 participants were female and 494 (43·9%) were male; 44 (7·0%) of 632 women were pregnant. The median age was 45 years (IQR 37-54) and median BMI was 29·8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR 27·0-34·2). Overall, 93 (8·3%) of 1126 participants reported receipt of a long COVID diagnosis by day 300. The cumulative incidence of long COVID by day 300 was 6·3% (95% CI 4·2-8·2) in participants who received metformin and 10·4% (7·8-12·9) in those who received identical metformin placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·39-0·89; p=0·012). The metformin beneficial effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0·37 (95% CI 0·15-0·95). There was no effect on cumulative incidence of long COVID with ivermectin (HR 0·99, 95% CI 0·59-1·64) or fluvoxamine (1·36, 0·78-2·34) compared with placebo. Outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long COVID incidence by about 41%, with an absolute reduction of 4·1%, compared with placebo. Metformin has clinical benefits when used as outpatient treatment for COVID-19 and is globally available, low-cost, and safe.

Secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial. Not applicable. A total of 333 women with anovulatory infertility attributed to PCOS who participated in the double-blind randomized trial entitled the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome I (PPCOS I) study (registration number, NCT00068861) who had serum samples from baseline laboratory testing available for further serum analysis were studied. Not applicable. The association between the baseline AMH levels in each of the 3 treatment groups and ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth rates were assessed. A total of 322 individuals had a baseline AMH concentration available, of which the mean AMH was 11.7 ± 8.3 ng/mL (range 0.1-43.0 ng/mL). With each unit (1 ng/mL) increase in baseline AMH, the odds of ovulation decreased by 10% (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.93); this effect did not differ by treatment group. Women with a high baseline AMH concentration (>8 ng/mL) were significantly less likely to ovulate compared with those with a normal baseline AMH concentration (<4 ng/mL) (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.68). This remained statistically significant when controlling for confounders, including age, body mass index, time in study, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance score. Ovulation occurred even at very high AMH concentrations; there was no maximum level noted at which no ovulation events occurred. Baseline AMH concentration was not associated with pregnancy or live birth rates when controlling for confounders. These AMH values in well-phenotyped individuals with PCOS add to the literature and will aid in identifying AMH criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS. In women with infertility and PCOS, a higher AMH concentration was associated with reduced odds of ovulation with ovulation induction with clomiphene, clomiphene + metformin, and metformin. The original trial from which this analysis is derived was entitled \"Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A 30 Week Double-Blind Randomized Trial of Clomiphene Citrate, Metformin XR, and Combined Clomiphene Citrate/Metformin XR For the Treatment of Infertility in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\" and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as number NCT00068861. The URL for the trial is https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00068861. The first subject was enrolled in November 2002.",

Metformin and curcumin have shown promise in improving these metabolic and hormonal parameters individually, but their combined effects in PCOS remain unclear. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week factorial trial involving 200 women with PCOS. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive metformin (500-mg/8 h) + placebo, nanocurcumin soft gel capsule (80-mg/8 h) + placebo, metformin (500-mg/8 h) + nanocurcumin (80-mg/8 h), or double placebo. Lipid profiles, glucose metabolism markers, hormonal parameters, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and week 12. The combination of metformin and curcumin demonstrated significant improvements in lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, hormonal parameters, body weight, and BMI compared to individual agents or placebo. Greater reductions in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels were observed with the combination therapy, along with increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol. Additionally, the combination therapy significantly improved markers of glucose metabolism and showed synergistic effects in reducing body weight and BMI. Reductions in testosterone and improvements in Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were also observed with combination therapy. The combination of metformin and curcumin demonstrates superior efficacy in improving lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, hormonal parameters, body weight, and BMI in women with PCOS compared to individual agents or placebo. This highlights the potential synergistic effects of combining these agents for the management of PCOS.",

Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2018/05/014196). ART Clinic, AIIMS, New Delhi patients: 102 infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF cycles were enrolled after evaluating for eligibility and allotted as 50 in group 1 (Myo) and 52 in group 2 (Met) after randomization. Recruited patients received Myo 2 g twice daily (group 1) and Met 850 mg twice daily (group 2). Pre- and post-treatment clinical (menstrual pattern, BMI), hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin [PRL], and AMH), biochemical parameters (HOMA IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), ovarian with antral follicle count (AFC) and side effect profile were assessed. After 3 months of therapy, patients were recruited for IVF cycle by antagonist protocol was involving controlled ovarian stimulation, cycle monitoring, oocyte recovery, insemination of oocytes and follow up with fertilization, cleavage, transfer of good grade cleavage embryos, or blastocysts pregnancy outcomes and OHSS incidence and medications was continued until the day of OPU. Primary outcome was OHSS and clinical pregnancy rate including spontaneous, IVF, and cumulative pregnancy rate including FET. Secondary outcome was ART outcomes and the change in biochemistry and hormonal profile between groups and inter group after medications at 12 weeks. Incidence of OHSS (Myo 5 (10.0) (<i>n</i> = 50), Met 10 (20.0) (<i>n</i> = 50) <i>p</i> .07) was not statistically different between groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (Myo 18 (36.0) (<i>n</i> = 50), Met 9 (18.0) (<i>n</i> = 50) <i>p</i> .04) cumulative pregnancy rate including FET (Myo 16 (43.2) (<i>n</i> = 37) <i>vs.</i> Met 10) 22.7) (<i>n</i> = 44) <i>p</i> .05) and spontaneous conception (prior to IVF) Myo 13 (26.0) (<i>n</i> = 50), Met 6 (12.0) (<i>n</i> = 50) <i>p</i> .07) was significantly high in Myo group. No between group difference in ovarian stimulation outcomes including duration and dosage of gonadotropins, E2, P4 levels, number of follicles >14 mm on day of trigger. Number of oocytes retrieved and grade of maturity were similar between groups. Fertilization, cleavage and number of good grade embryos were significantly higher in Myo group. However, implantation rate and number of embryos for freezing were similar between groups. Myo had improvement in fasting insulin, HOMA, Sr.AMH, and SHBG suggesting decreased insulin resistance. Myo is equally beneficial as Met in reducing the risk of OHSS and has better ART outcome in PCOS women undergoing antagonist cycles.",

Studies have also indicated that the occurence of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) may also be associated with changes in the intestinal flora. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of metformin in treating FAP and the association with intestinal flora. Compared with the baseline, the mean number and load of polyps in the areas of nanocarbon labeling and postoperative residuals in the test group were lower than those in the placebo group, while the diversity of intestinal flora species was increased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of g_Ruminococcus in the test group was lower than that at baseline, whereas the relative abundance of g_Lactobacillus was higher. These changes were statistically significant (P < 0.05). One-year metformin therapy for FAP is safe and effective, potentially mediated by modulating the intestinal flora. This study provides new insights and strategies for preventing adenomatous polyp carcinogenesis in FAP and explores possible preventive action.",

We examined how alignment with the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Cancer Prevention Recommendations using the 2018 WCRF/AICR score was associated with incident lifestyle-related cancer in adults with prediabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP, 1996-2001) and DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS, 2002-2020), an observational follow-up of a randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to lifestyle, metformin, or placebo interventions (mean: 3 y) and followed for an additional 19 y. The 2018 WCRF/AICR score (0-7 points; higher score, better alignment) was calculated from body weight, physical activity, diet, and alcohol components at 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, and 15 y after randomization. Incident cancer was based on the 2018 WCRF/AICR 3rd Expert Report (18 cancers associated with lifestyle). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated associations between the score (baseline [0], change from 0 to 1 y, time dependent) and lifestyle-related cancer. Participants' (N = 3000) mean baseline WCRF/AICR score was 3.2 (SD: 1.1). There were 403 incident lifestyle-related cancer cases. Scores improved after 1 and 15 y (mean increase = 0.43 and 0.27 points, respectively, both P < 0.001). The baseline score was not associated with cancer risk. However, a 1-unit score improvement from 0 to 1 y and time-dependent scores were significantly associated with a 14% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.76, 0.97) and 9% (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.997) lower risk, respectively, with no effect modification by intervention group or diabetes status. In exploratory by-component analyses, no single component was associated with risk. Alignment with WCRF/AICR recommendations may lower cancer risk in adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of considering lifestyle factors for cancer prevention.

We investigated the association of T2D pPS with diabetes-related traits and T2D incidence in the Diabetes Prevention Program. We generated five T2D pPS (β-cell, proinsulin, liver/lipid, obesity, lipodystrophy) in 2,647 participants randomized to intensive lifestyle, metformin, or placebo arms. Associations were tested with general linear models and Cox regression with adjustment for age, sex, and principal components. Sensitivity analyses included adjustment for BMI. Higher β-cell pPS was associated with lower insulinogenic index and corrected insulin response at 1-year follow-up with adjustment for baseline measures (effect per pPS SD -0.04, P = 9.6 × 10-7, and -8.45 μU/mg, P = 5.6 × 10-6, respectively) and with increased diabetes incidence with adjustment for BMI at nominal significance (hazard ratio 1.10 per SD, P = 0.035). The liver/lipid pPS was associated with reduced 1-year baseline-adjusted triglyceride levels (effect per SD -4.37, P = 0.001). There was no significant interaction between T2D pPS and randomized groups. The remaining pPS were associated with baseline measures only. We conclude that despite interventions for diabetes prevention, participants with a high genetic burden of the β-cell cluster pPS had worsening in measures of β-cell function.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug. Several studies have suggested that metformin has anticancer activity in some malignancies, including prostate cancer. Metformin might also mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). We hypothesised that metformin might improve survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and reduce metabolic complications associated with ADT. The STAMPEDE multi-arm, multi-stage, randomised phase 3 trial recruited patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate staged by conventional imaging with isotope bone and CT scanning. This publication reports findings for the most recent STAMPEDE research question, testing the addition of metformin to standard of care for non-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] <48 mmol/mol [equivalent to <6·5%]) patients with metastatic disease with adequate renal function (glomerular filtration rate ≥45 ml/min/1·73 m<sup>2</sup>) and WHO performance status 0-2. This trial recruited from 112 hospitals in the UK and Switzerland to the STAMPEDE protocol. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to standard of care or standard of care plus metformin 850 mg twice daily. Random assignment was by telephone using minimisation with a random element of 20% (developed and maintained by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL), stratified for randomising hospital, age (<70 years vs ≥70 years), WHO performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), type of ADT, regular long-term use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; yes vs no), pelvic nodal status (positive vs negative), planned radiotherapy (yes vs no), and planned docetaxel or androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) use (docetaxel vs abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide vs none). Standard of care comprised ADT with or without radiotherapy and with or without docetaxel or ARPI. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, defined as the time to death from any cause, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in patients who started treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00268476 and ISRCTN, ISRCTN78818544. Between Sep 5, 2016, and Mar 31, 2023, 1874 patients with metastatic disease were randomly allocated to standard of care (n=938) or standard of care plus metformin (n=936). The median patient age was 69 years (IQR 63-73) and the median PSA was 84 ng/mL (24-352). 1758 (94%) of 1874 patients were newly diagnosed with metastatic disease and 116 (6%) were diagnosed with metachronous relapsing disease. 1543 (82%) of 1874 patients received ADT plus docetaxel and 52 (3%) received abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide. The median time to most recent case report form follow-up was 60 months (IQR 49-72). 473 deaths were reported in the standard of care group; median survival was 61·8 months (IQR 29·7 to not reached). There were 453 deaths in the metformin group; median survival was 67·4 months (32·5 to not reached; HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·80-1·03; p=0·15). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 487 (52%) of 938 patients in the standard of care group and 523 (57%) of 921 patients in the standard of care plus metformin group. 61 (7%) patients in the standard of care group and 84 (9%) patients in the standard of care plus metformin group reported at least one grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal adverse event; all other body systems showed no difference in grade 3 adverse events. There were six drug-related deaths in the standard of care group and one in the standard of care plus metformin group. We did not find significant evidence of an overall survival benefit of adding metformin to standard of care in the overall population of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The side-effect profile of metformin was as expected and consisted mainly of diarrhoea. Adverse metabolic side-effects of ADT were significantly reduced in the metformin group compared with the standard of care group.

      "abstract": "Surgery induces a stress response, causing insulin resistance that may result in postoperative hyperglycemia, which is associated with increased incidence of complications, longer hospitalization, and greater mortality. This study examined the effect of metformin treatment on the percentage of patients experiencing postoperative hyperglycemia after elective colon cancer surgery. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study was conducted at Slagelse Hospital in Slagelse, Denmark. Patients without diabetes planned for elective surgery for colon cancer were included. Patients received metformin (500 mg 3× per day) or placebo for 20 days before and 10 days after surgery. Blood glucose levels were measured several times daily until the end of postoperative day 2. The main outcome measures were the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 blood glucose measurement >7.7 and 10 mmol/L, respectively. Rates of complications within 30 days of surgery and Quality of Recovery-15 scores were also recorded. Of the 48 included patients, 21 patients (84.0%) in the placebo group and 18 patients (78.3%) in the metformin group had at least 1 blood glucose measurement >7.7 mmol/L ( p = 0.72), and 13 patients (52.0%) in the placebo group had a measurement >10.0 mmol/L versus 5 patients (21.7%) in the metformin group ( p = 0.04). No differences in complication rates or Quality of Recovery-15 scores were seen. The number of patients in the study was too low to detect a possible difference in postoperative complications. Blood glucose was measured as spot measurements instead of continuous surveillance. In patients without diabetes, metformin significantly reduced the percentage of patients experiencing postoperative hyperglycemia, as defined as spot blood glucose measurements >10 mmol/L after elective colon cancer surgery.

      "abstract": "Hyperinsulemia and glycemic control may play a role as prostate cancer prognostic factors, whereas use of certain antidiabetic drugs, that is metformin, could improve the prognosis. We examined the link between antidiabetic medication use and prostate cancer survival taking into account simultaneous use of multiple drugs. The study cohort composed of 6,537 men in The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with prostate cancer diagnosed 1996 to 2009. Use of medication was attained from the nationwide prescription database of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Median follow-up was 9.2 years postdiagnosis. A total of 1,603 (24,5%) men had used antidiabetic medication. A total of 771 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to evaluate the risk of prostate cancer death and onset of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with adjustment for prostate cancer clinical characteristics, comorbidities and use of other drugs. Separate analyses were further adjusted for blood glucose. Risk of prostate cancer death was higher among antidiabetic drug users overall (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) compared with nonusers, separately among insulin and metformin users. Adjustment for blood glucose level abolished the risk increase. Risk of ADT initiation was increased among the medication users (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.49). Men with prostate cancer using antidiabetic medication are generally at increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with nonusers. The risk association is driven by underlying diabetes, as adjustment for blood glucose level ameliorates the risk increase. Type 2 diabetes should be considered as a risk factor when considering prostate cancer prognosis.",

From 1996 to 1999, 3,234 adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention, masked metformin, or placebo. Placebo and lifestyle interventions stopped in 2001, and a modified lifestyle program was offered to everyone, but unmasked study metformin continued in those originally randomized. Causes of deaths through 31 December 2018 were adjudicated by blinded reviews. All-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models and Fine-Gray models, respectively. Over a median of 21 years (interquartile range 20-21), 453 participants died. Cancer was the leading cause of death (<i>n</i> = 170), followed by cardiovascular disease (<i>n</i> = 131). Compared with placebo, metformin did not influence mortality from all causes (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.79, 1.25]), cancer (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.72, 1.52]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.70, 1.66]). Similarly, lifestyle modification did not impact all-cause (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.81, 1.28]), cancer (HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.74, 1.55]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.77, 1.81]) mortality. Analyses adjusted for diabetes status and duration, BMI, cumulative glycemic exposure, and cardiovascular risks yielded results similar to those for all-cause mortality. Cancer was the leading cause of mortality among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Although metformin and lifestyle modification prevented diabetes, neither strategy reduced all-cause, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality rates.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a known risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer and may increase risk for triple negative breast cancer in premenopausal women. Intervention strategies are clearly needed to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk. We conducted a Phase II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin in overweight/obese premenopausal women with components of metabolic syndrome to assess the potential of metformin for primary breast cancer prevention. Eligible participants were randomized to receive metformin (850 mg BID, n = 76) or placebo (n = 75) for 12 months. Outcomes included breast density, assessed by fat/water MRI with change in percent breast density as the primary endpoint, anthropometric measures, and intervention feasibility. Seventy-six percent in the metformin arm and 83% in the placebo arm (p = 0.182) completed the 12-month intervention. Adherence to study agent was high with more than 80% of participants taking ≥ 80% assigned pills. The most common adverse events reported in the metformin arm were gastrointestinal in nature and subsided over time. Compared to placebo, metformin intervention led to a significant reduction in waist circumference (p < 0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.019). Compared to placebo, metformin did not change percent breast density and dense breast volume but led to a numerical but not significant decrease in non-dense breast volume (p = 0.070). We conclude that metformin intervention resulted in favorable changes in anthropometric measures of adiposity and a borderline decrease in non-dense breast volume in women with metabolic dysregulation. More research is needed to understand the impact of metformin on breast cancer risk reduction. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02028221.

We sought to determine the effects of behavioral weight loss and metformin treatment on SU in a randomized trial. <b>Methods and Findings:</b> The Survivorship Promotion In Reducing IGF-1 Trial (SPIRIT) was a parallel three-arm randomized controlled trial of overweight/obese adult cancer survivors without gout at a single center in Maryland, United States. Participants were randomized to: (1) coach-directed weight loss (behavioral telephonic coaching), (2) metformin (up to 2000 mg daily), or (3) self-directed weight loss (informational brochures; reference group). SU and BMI were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. The 121 participants had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 60 ± 9 years, 79% were female, and 45% were Black. At baseline, BMI was 35 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and SU was 5.6 ± 1.3 mg/dL. Compared to the self-directed group, at 12 months, the coach-directed group reduced BMI by 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.5, -0.4) and metformin reduced BMI by 0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -1.1, -0.1). However, compared to the self-directed group, the coach-directed group unexpectedly increased SU by 0.3 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.05, 0.6), and metformin non-significantly increased SU by 0.2 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.04, 0.5); these effects were attenuated when analyses included change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). <b>Conclusions:</b> In this randomized trial of cancer survivors without gout, reductions in BMI either increased or did not change SU, potentially due to effects on eGFR. These results do not support a focus on BMI reduction for SU reduction; however, long-term studies are needed. <b>ClinicalTrials.gov Registration</b>: NCT02431676.",

A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to receive Diane-35 alone (D group), Diane-35 plus orlistat (DO group), Diane-35 plus metformin (DM group), or Diane-35 plus orlistat plus metformin (DOM group). Serum TT, DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, FT, FAI, body fat, and body fat percentage were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant changes in serum TT, SHBG, and FAI were observed in all treatment groups compared with baseline. DHEA-S and androstenedione significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups after treatment. FT only significantly decreased in the DOM group. Body fat and body fat percentage significantly decreased in the DO and DOM groups. Compared with the D group, DHEA-S significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups (F = 4.081, p = 0.008); SHBG significantly increased in the DOM group (F = 3.019, p = 0.031); and FAI significantly decreased in the DO group (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.578, p = 0.006). There were significant differences between groups in body fat percentage (χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.590, p < 0.001). Side-effects were less with orlistat than metformin. Diane-35 in combination with orlistat or metformin is more effective in reducing androgen than Diane-35 alone. Orlistat is more effective in reducing body fat percentage than metformin. In addition, orlistat has mild side-effects and is better tolerated compared with metformin.",

A total of 1,442 participants were randomly assigned to one of four interventions: 1) MET (1,700 mg/day) plus MedDiet intervention (MET+MedDiet); 2) placebo plus MedDiet intervention; 3) MET (1,700 mg/day) alone; and 4) placebo alone. Participants were followed up for 3 years on average. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of major noncommunicable diseases (including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the changing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The crude incidence of the major noncommunicable diseases was 6.7 cases per 100 person-years in the MET+MedDiet group, 6.9 in the MET alone group, 13.3 in the placebo plus MedDiet group, and 11.3 in the placebo group. The differences were fully explained by the reduction of type 2 diabetes, which was 80% and 92% lower in the MET and MET+MedDiet groups, respectively, compared with placebo. The use of 1,700 mg/day MET is effective to prevent diabetes in people selected on the basis of metabolic syndrome.",

The primary outcome was change in body fat percentage. The secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, fat mass, fat-free mass, liver function variables and uric acid. Tofogliflozin and glimepiride reduced HbA1c to a similar extent. Body fat percentage did not change from baseline in either group. Fat mass was reduced by tofogliflozin but was increased by glimepiride (by -2.0 ± 1.7 kg and +1.6 ± 1.6 kg, P = .002). Fat-free mass was also reduced by tofogliflozin and increased by glimepiride (by -1.3 ± 1.3 kg and +0.9 ± 2.0 kg, P < .001). Alanine aminotransferase and uric acid levels were reduced by tofogliflozin (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). These data provide novel information useful for selecting the third oral agent for patients whose diabetes is inadequately controlled with metformin plus DPP-4i dual therapy.",

Midpregnancy Doppler ultrasound is one of the best methods for prediction of adverse pregnancy outcome. The objectives of the study were to investigate the following: 1) whether metformin treatment influenced the midpregnancy pulsatility index (PI) of the uterine artery; 2) whether metabolic or endocrine factors affect the PI of the uterine artery of PCOS women; and 3) whether PI predicted adverse pregnancy outcome in PCOS woman. This is a substudy of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study conducted at 11 secondary care centers. We randomly assigned 273 pregnancies to receive metformin or placebo, from the first trimester of pregnancy to delivery. In the present substudy, 231 pregnancies are included, ie, those who completed the ultrasound examinations. Midpregnancy PI in the uterine artery related to metformin use, androgen levels, an oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin levels was measured. We found no difference in the PI between the metformin and placebo groups. In multivariate analyses, fasting serum glucose of the first and second trimester correlated positively to the midpregnancy PI. Only in univariate analyses a weak correlation between androstenedione and PI was seen. Metformin treatment did not affect uterine artery blood flow, measured by PI. High fasting blood glucose correlated inversely to uterine artery blood flow. The midpregnancy PI correlated positively to preeclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes mellitus in PCOS pregnancies. Androgen levels correlated only to PI in univariate analyses.",

We therefore examined its effects in combination with gefitinib in patients without diabetes harboring EGFR mutations (EGFRm). A total of 224 patients without diabetes with treatment-naïve stage IIIB-IV EGFRm NSCLC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gefitinib plus either metformin or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Serum levels of IL6 were also examined in an exploratory analysis. The median duration of follow-up was 19.15 months. The estimated 1-year PFS rates were 41.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30.0-52.2] with gefitinib plus metformin and 42.9% (95% CI, 32.6-52.7) with gefitinib plus placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.6268). Median PFS (10.3 months vs. 11.4 months) and median OS (22.0 months vs. 27.5 months) were numerically lower in the metformin group, while ORRs were similar between the two arms (66% vs. 66.7%). No significant treatment group differences were detected across all subgroups with respect to PFS, including those with elevated levels of IL6. Metformin combined with gefitinib resulted in a remarkably higher incidence of diarrhea compared with the control arm (78.38% vs. 43.24%). Our study showed that addition of metformin resulted in nonsignificantly worse outcomes and increased toxicity and hence does not support its concurrent use with first-line EGFR-TKI therapy in patients without diabetes with EGFRm NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "Impaired insulin activity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome might differ from that seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus without polycystic ovary syndrome. This study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with metformin, saxagliptin, and their combination in newly diagnosed women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome in China. A total of 75 newly diagnosed patients from Shanghai, China with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome were included in this randomized, parallel, open-label study. All patients received treatment for 24 weeks with metformin, saxagliptin, or their combination. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups by a computer-generated code that facilitated equal patient distribution of 25 patients per group. The primary outcome was a change in glycemic control and β-cell function. A total of 63 patients completed the study (n = 21, for each group). The reduction in hemoglobin A1c was significant in the combination group, compared to the monotherapy groups (saxagliptin vs. combination treatment vs. metformin: - 1.1 vs. -1.3 vs. -1.1%, P = 0.016), whereas it was comparable between the metformin and saxagliptin groups (P > 0.05). Saxagliptin, metformin, and the combination treatment significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment- insulin resistance index and increased the deposition index (P < 0.01 for all). However, no significant change was observed in the homeostasis model assessment- β-cell function among the metformin and combination groups, and no significant changes were observed in the insulinogenic index among all three groups (P > 0.05 for all). In addition, saxagliptin and metformin treatments significantly reduced body mass index and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.01 for both). Saxagliptin and metformin were comparably effective in regulating weight loss, glycemic control, and β-cell function, improving lipid profiles, and reducing inflammation in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      "abstract": "The best treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes in whom treatment with metformin alone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control is debated. We aimed to compare the long-term effects of pioglitazone versus sulfonylureas, given in addition to metformin, on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. TOSCA.IT was a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic clinical trial, in which patients aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy (2-3 g per day) were recruited from 57 diabetes clinics in Italy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by permuted blocks randomisation (block size 10), stratified by site and previous cardiovascular events, to add-on pioglitazone (15-45 mg) or a sulfonylurea (5-15 mg glibenclamide, 2-6 mg glimepiride, or 30-120 mg gliclazide, in accordance with local practice). The trial was unblinded, but event adjudicators were unaware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was a composite of first occurrence of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or urgent coronary revascularisation, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants with baseline data available and without any protocol violations in relation to inclusion or exclusion criteria). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700856. Between Sept 18, 2008, and Jan 15, 2014, 3028 patients were randomly assigned and included in the analyses. 1535 were assigned to pioglitazone and 1493 to sulfonylureas (glibenclamide 24 [2%], glimepiride 723 [48%], gliclazide 745 [50%]). At baseline, 335 (11%) participants had a previous cardiovascular event. The study was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis after a median follow-up of 57·3 months. The primary outcome occurred in 105 patients (1·5 per 100 person-years) who were given pioglitazone and 108 (1·5 per 100 person-years) who were given sulfonylureas (hazard ratio 0·96, 95% CI 0·74-1·26, p=0·79). Fewer patients had hypoglycaemias in the pioglitazone group than in the sulfonylureas group (148 [10%] vs 508 [34%], p<0·0001). Moderate weight gain (less than 2 kg, on average) occurred in both groups. Rates of heart failure, bladder cancer, and fractures were not significantly different between treatment groups. In this long-term, pragmatic trial, incidence of cardiovascular events was similar with sulfonylureas (mostly glimepiride and gliclazide) and pioglitazone as add-on treatments to metformin. Both of these widely available and affordable treatments are suitable options with respect to efficacy and adverse events, although pioglitazone was associated with fewer hypoglycaemia events.

A randomised, single-centre, open-label, controlled trial conducted between October 2013 and December 2017. Shanghai OBGYN Hospital of Fudan University, China. A total of 150 patients (18-45 years old) with primary AEH or well-differentiated EEC were randomised into an MA group (n = 74) and an MA plus metformin group (n = 76). Patients with AEH or EEC were firstly stratified, then randomised to receive MA (160 mg orally, daily) or MA (160 mg orally, daily) plus metformin (500 mg orally, three times a day). The primary efficacy parameter was the cumulate complete response (CR) rate within 16 weeks of treatment (16w-CR rate); the secondary efficacy parameters were 30w-CR rate and adverse events. The 16w-CR rate was higher in the metformin plus MA group than in the MA-only group (34.3 versus 20.7%, odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-4.51, P = 0.09) but the difference was more significant in 102 AEH patients (39.6 versus 20.4%, OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.06-6.21, P = 0.04). This effect of metformin was also significant in non-obese (51.4 versus 24.3%, OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.22-8.84, P = 0.02) and insulin-sensitive (54.8 versus 28.6%, OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.03-8.97, P = 0.04) subgroups of AEH women. No significant result was found in secondary endpoints. As a fertility-sparing treatment, metformin plus MA was associated with a higher early CR rate compared with MA alone in AEH patients. For AEH patients, metformin plus MA might be a better fertility-sparing treatment to achieve a higher early CR rate compared with MA alone.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is widely prescribed to pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an attempt to reduce pregnancy complications. Metformin is not approved for this indication, and evidence for this practice is lacking. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that metformin, from first trimester to delivery, reduces pregnancy complications in women with PCOS. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study at 11 secondary care centers. The participants were 257 women with PCOS, in the first trimester of pregnancy, aged 18-42 yr. We randomly assigned 274 singleton pregnancies (in 257 women) to receive metformin or placebo, from first trimester to delivery. The prevalence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm delivery, and a composite of these three outcomes is reported. Preeclampsia prevalence was 7.4% in the metformin group and 3.7% in the placebo group (3.7%; 95% CI, -1.7-9.2) (P=0.18). Preterm delivery prevalence was 3.7% in the metformin group and 8.2% in the placebo group (-4.4%; 95%, CI, -10.1-1.2) (P=0.12). Gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence was 17.6% in the metformin group and 16.9% in the placebo group (0.8%; 95% CI, -8.6-10.2) (P=0.87). The composite primary endpoint prevalence was 25.9 and 24.4%, respectively (1.5%; 95% CI, -8.9-11.3) (P=0.78). Women in the metformin group gained less weight during pregnancy compared with those in the placebo group. There was no difference in fetal birth weight between the groups. Metformin treatment from first trimester to delivery did not reduce pregnancy complications in PCOS.",

Omega-3 fatty acids had neutral effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The ORIGIN and Legacy Effects (ORIGINALE) study measured posttrial effects of these interventions during an additional 2.7 years. Surviving ORIGIN participants attended up to two additional visits. The hazard of clinical outcomes during the entire follow-up period from randomization was calculated. Of 12,537 participants randomized, posttrial data were analyzed for 4,718 originally allocated to insulin glargine (2,351) versus standard care (2,367), and 4,771 originally allocated to omega-3 fatty acid supplements (2,368) versus placebo (2,403). Posttrial, small differences in median HbA1c persisted (glargine 6.6% [49 mmol/mol], standard care 6.7% [50 mmol/mol], P = 0.025). From randomization to the end of posttrial follow-up, no differences were found between the glargine and standard care groups in myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (1,185 vs. 1,165 events; hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.94-1.10]; P = 0.72); myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure (1,958 vs. 1,910 events; 1.03 [0.97-1.10]; P = 0.38); or any cancer (524 vs. 529 events; 0.99 [0.88-1.12]; P = 0.91) or between omega-3 and placebo groups in cardiovascular death (688 vs. 700; 0.98 [0.88-1.09]; P = 0.68) or other outcomes. During >6 years of treatment followed by >2.5 years of observation, insulin glargine had neutral effects on health outcomes and salutary effects on metabolic control, whereas omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had no effect.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether metformin decreases metabolic syndrome (MS) risk in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, normoglycemic patients with PCa planned for at least 9 months of ADT were randomized 2:1 to receive metformin 850 mg or placebo twice daily orally for 18 months. The primary objective was to compare proportions of MS at 18 months between the study arms. Between July 2018 and November 2023, 166 patients were randomized. The trial closed prematurely on November 24, 2023, because of drug supply cessation and the planned enrollment numbers (n = 300) were not met. A total of 90 (metformin) and 45 patients (placebo) were analyzed in the final analysis. The median follow-up was 24 months (IQR: 19.5-36 months). Proportions of MS between metformin and placebo arms were 38/90 (42%) vs 26/45 (58%) at baseline (<i>P</i> = .09) and 40/73 (55%) vs 23/34 (68%) at 18 months (<i>P</i> = .2). Significant reductions in mean (SD) body weight occurred with metformin at 9 (-0.9 [4] vs +1.8 [3.8] kg; <i>P</i> < .001) and 12 months (-0.33 [3.9] vs +1.8 [3.9] kg; <i>P</i> = .004). Mean (SD) hemoglobin A1c was lowered with metformin at 9% (-0.02% [0.23%] vs +0.08% [0.26%]; <i>P</i> = .02) and 12 months (+0.03% [0.27%] vs +0.08% [0.27%]; <i>P</i> = .03). Significantly smaller increments in mean (SD) waist circumferences were noted with metformin at 9 (+0.8 [4.3] vs +2.9 [5.7] cm; <i>P</i> = .03), 12 (+1.9 [5.1] vs +3.3 [6] cm; <i>P</i> = .15), and 18 months (+1.8 [3.8] vs +3.8 [6.1] cm; <i>P</i> = .03). Metformin did not reduce the risk of MS in patients with PCa on ADT. However, significant improvements in body weight, waist circumference, and hemoglobin A1c suggest a potential role for metformin in reducing ADT-related complications.",

However, the anti-cancer effect of metformin for diabetic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver resection remains unclear. The aim of our cohort study was to assess whether metformin influence the recurrence of HCC. We retrospectively enrolled 857 HCC patients who received primary resection from April 2001 to June 2016. 222 patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) from medical record. Factors influence the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by multivariate analysis. During the follow-up period (mean, 75 months), 471 (54.9%) patients experienced recurrence, and 158 (18.4%) patients died. Multivariate analysis revealed that DM (p = 0.015), elevated AST (p = 0.006), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.003), tumor number (p = 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), vascular invasion (p <0.001), high Ishak fibrosis score (p <0.001), hepatitis B (p = 0.014), hepatitis C (p = 0.001) were independent predictors for RFS. In diabetic patients, only HbA1c>9% (p = 0.033), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.030) and vascular invasion (p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence; but the metformin use revealed no significance on recurrence. DM is a risk factor of HCC recurrence after resection. Adequate DM control can reduce the recurrence of HCC. However, the use of metformin does not reduce the risk of HCC recurrence in diabetic patient after initial resection. Hence, metformin may not have protective influences on HCC recurrence in diabetic patients who undergo initial liver resection.",

Prospective randomized study. University Hospital endocrinology outpatient clinic. Young women with PCOS (aged 23.3±4.9 years). Patients were assigned randomly to no treatment (n=14), metformin 850 mg two times per day (n=15), and pioglitazone 30 mg daily (n=14) for 6 months. Healthy age- and body mass index-matched women served as controls (n=14). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was studied at baseline and 6 months. Women with PCOS had higher insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices and lower flow-mediated dilation compared with controls. The three groups of women with PCOS did not differ at baseline. No differences were observed at follow-up in women who received no treatment. Metformin and pioglitazone improved flow-mediated dilation to a similar extent, restoring it to normal values at 6 months. Both insulin sensitizers induced favorable changes in insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism indices in women with PCOS. Independent predictors of flow-mediated dilation improvement at 6 months were treatment with insulin sensitizers and reduction in insulin resistance. In young women with PCOS, treatment with metformin or pioglitazone for 6 months induces a similar beneficial effect on endothelial function; this may be partially attributed to an improvement in insulin resistance. Further research is needed to investigate whether treatment with insulin sensitizers in women with PCOS also reduces cardiovascular risk.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. HCC burden has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years. Most HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options. Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied. Metformin may decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of combined treatment are still unclear. As HCC is characterized by high vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 α could offer information about HCC response to sorafenib. We conducted this study to assess the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of VEGF and HIF-1 α in HCC prognosis. This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF and HIF-1 α were evaluated. We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 49-68 years). Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%). Sixty percent of patients were diabetic. No significant difference was detected between arm A and arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression (p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6). Low VEGF and HIF-1 α plasma levels were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for both), and higher OS (p < 0.001). Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). No superior efficacy of adding metformin to sorafenib in HCC treatment. VEGF and HIF-1 α had promising prognostic value in HCC.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer patients treated with adriamycin-cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel (AC-T) are often challenged with serious adverse effects for which no effective therapies are available. Here, we investigated whether metformin, an antidiabetic drug with additional pleiotropic effects could favourably offset AC-T induced toxicities. Seventy non-diabetic breast cancer patients were randomised to receive either AC-T (adriamycin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 4 cycles Q21 days, followed by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 12 cycles) alone or AC-T plus metformin (1700 mg/day). Patients were assessed regularly after each cycle to record the incidence and severity of adverse events based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0. Moreover, baseline echocardiography and ultrasonography were done and repeated after the end of neoadjuvant therapy. Addition of metformin to AC-T resulted in significantly less incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy, oral mucositis, and fatigue (p < 0.05) compared to control arm. Moreover, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) in the control arm dropped from a mean of 66.69 ± 4.57 to 62.2 ± 5.22% (p = 0.0004) versus a preserved cardiac function in the metformin arm (64.87 ± 4.84 to 65.94 ± 3.44%, p = 0.2667). Furthermore, fatty liver incidence was significantly lower in metformin compared with control arm (8.33% vs 51.85%, p = 0.001). By contrast, haematological disturbances caused by AC-T were preserved after concurrent metformin administration (p > 0.05). Metformin offers a therapeutic opportunity for controlling toxicities caused by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-diabetic breast cancer patients. This randomised controlled trial was registered on November 20, 2019 in ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number: NCT04170465.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several clinical trials have attempted to find evidence that supports the anticancer use of metformin in breast cancer (BC) patients. The current study evaluates the anticancer activity of metformin in addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced BC patients. Additionally, we assess the safety and tolerability of this combination and its effect on the quality of life (QoL) of BC patients. Eighty non-diabetic female patients with proven locally advanced BC were randomized into two arms. The first arm received anthracycline/taxane-based NACT plus metformin. The second arm received anthracycline/taxane-based NACT only. Overall response rate (ORR), clinical complete response (cCr), pathological complete response (pCR), and breast conservative rate (BCR) were evaluated between both groups, and correlated with serum metformin concentration. ORR, cCr, pCR, and BCR increased non-significantly in the metformin group compared to the control group; 80.6% vs 68.4%, 27.8% vs 10.5%, 22.2% vs 10.5%, and 19.4% vs 13.2%, respectively. A trend towards cCR and pCR was associated with higher serum metformin concentrations. Metformin decreased the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, bone pain, and arthralgia, although worsened the gastrointestinal adverse events. Metformin combination with NACT has no effect on the QoL of BC patients. Metformin combination with NACT is safe, tolerable, and improves non-significantly the clinical and pathological tumor response of BC patients.",

      "abstract": "In preclinical work and retrospective population studies, the anti-diabetic drug metformin has been associated with antineoplastic activity and decreased burden of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer. There is therefore interest in the hypothesis that this drug might be repurposed for indications in oncology. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the addition of metformin to a standard systemic therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, and provide the first report of a clinical trial with a survival endpoint of metformin for an oncological indication. We did this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at four centres in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (1:1), via a permutated computer-generated block allocation scheme (block size of six) to receive intravenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks and oral erlotinib (100mg) once daily in combination with either oral metformin or placebo twice daily. Metformin dose was escalated from 500 mg (in the first week) to 1000 mg twice daily in the second week. Randomisation was stratified by hospital, diabetes status, and tumour stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 6 months in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01210911. Between May 31, 2010, and Jan 3, 2014, we randomly assigned 121 patients to receive gemcitabine and erlotinib with either placebo (n=61) or metformin (n=60). Overall survival at 6 months was 63·9% (95% CI 51·9-75·9) in the placebo group and 56·7% (44·1-69·2) in the metformin group (p=0·41). There was no difference in overall survival between groups (median 7·6 months [95% CI 6·1-9·1] vs 6·8 months [95% CI 5·1-8·5] in the metformin group; hazard ratio [HR] 1·056 [95% CI 0·72-1·55]; log-rank p=0·78). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxic effects were neutropenia (15 [25%] patients in placebo group vs 15 [25%] in metformin group), skin rash (six [10%] vs four [7%]), diarrhoea (three [5%] vs six [10%]), and fatigue (two [3%] vs six [10%]). Addition of a conventional anti-diabetic dose of metformin does not improve outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine and erlotinib. Future research should include studies of more potent biguanides, and should focus on patients with hyperinsulinaemia and patients with tumours showing markers of sensitivity to energetic stress, such as loss of function of AMP kinase, a key regulator of cellular energy homoeostasis.

The use of metformin is of benefit to women with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to compare the stimulation characteristics and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer (ET) outcomes of the standard short GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation with or without metformin. We recruited 40 PCOS patients. The population studied was divided into two groups (A and B). Group A was pretreated for 2 months with metformin 1.5 g/day (Glucophage(R); Merck Pharm), and then stimulated with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) 150 UI/day (Gonal F(R) 75 UI; Serono). GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix acetate 0.25 mg/day (Cetrotide(R); Serono), was started when the leading follicle reached 14 mm diameter on ultrasound scan. Group B was treated only with rFSH 150 UI/day and GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg/day when the leading follicle was >or=14 mm in diameter. In group A we found a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the number of ampoules of rFSH (A vs. B: 18+/-6 vs. 24+/-8) and estradiol levels (A vs. B: 2400+/-600 vs. 3370+/-900 pg/ml) (all values mean+/-standard deviation). Group A had significantly fewer cancelled cycles (A vs. B: 1 vs. 3; p < 0.05). The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was 5% in group A and 15% in group B (p < 0.05). In patients treated with metformin, the total number of follicles on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment (23+/-1.2 vs. 33+/-2.6) was decreased with no change in the number of follicles >or=14 mm in diameter (A vs. B: 18+/-1.2 vs. 19+/-1.7). However, the mean number of mature oocytes (A vs. B: 8.4+/-1.5 vs. 5.0+/-1.5) was increased with metformin treatment (p < 0.05). No difference was found in the number of cleaved embryos (A vs. B: 2.5+/-0.5 vs. 2.2+/-0.3). The use of metformin with GnRH antagonist improves the outcome of ovarian stimulation in IVF-ET cycles in PCOS patients.",

      "abstract": "Few prospective studies have compared the cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin for modulating cardiometabolic risk factors including high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, hypoglycemia, and body weight. This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group trial enrolled 340 Japanese patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes receiving metformin alone or no glucose-lowering agents, who were randomized to receive dapagliflozin or sitagliptin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), avoidance of hypoglycemia (maintenance of sensor glucose ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or ≥ 54 mg/dL), and ≥ 3.0% body weight loss from baseline. Secondary endpoints included components of the primary endpoint, other metabolic indices, and glucose variability indices measured using flash glucose monitoring. Clinical characteristics of patients were age, 58.1 ± 12.2 years; known duration of diabetes, 5.8 ± 6.1 years; body weight, 74.7 ± 14.2 kg; body mass index, 27.9 ± 4.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and HbA1c level, 7.8 ± 0.8% at baseline. The achievement ratio of primary endpoint was significantly higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the sitagliptin group (24.4% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.05). While the rates of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and avoidance of hypoglycemia were comparable between the groups (49.4 vs. 50.0% and 88.7 vs. 92.3% for dapagliflozin vs. sitagliptin, respectively), body weight loss of ≥ 3.0% was significantly achieved in the dapagliflozin group (54.4 vs. 19.6%, P < 0.001). Moreover, dapagliflozin was superior to sitagliptin regarding several secondary endpoints that modulate cardiometabolic risk, namely reducing fasting plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and suppressing the increase in serum creatinine and the decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, sitagliptin was superior to dapagliflozin in suppressing glucose variability. Compared to sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was significantly more effective at improving cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors might be more suitable than DPP-4 inhibitors for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with early-stage but inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common benign solid breast mass in women, with no definite method of management. Because fibroadenoma is dependent on female sex hormones and comprises hypertrophic changes at cellular levels, we investigated the effects of metformin (MF), a safe hypoglycemic agent with anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative properties, in the management of fibroadenoma. In this randomized clinical trial study, eligible women with fibroadenomas were assigned randomly to the metformin (1000 mg daily for six months) or the placebo group. Breast physical and ultrasound exam was performed before and after the intervention, and the changes in the size of fibroadenomas were compared in the two groups. Overall, 83 patients in the treatment, and 92 in the placebo group completed the study. A statistically significant difference in changing size between the two groups was observed only in the smallest mass. In the largest FAs, the rate of size reduction was higher in the treatment group (60.2 % vs. 43.5 %); while a higher rate of enlargement was observed in the placebo group (38 % vs. 20.5 %). In the smallest FAs, the rate of the masses that got smaller or remained stable was about 90 % in the treatment group and 50 % in the placebo group. We categorized size changes of FAs into < 20 % enlargement and ≥ 20 % enlargement. The odds ratio (OR) for an elargemnt less than 20% was 1.48 (95 % CI = 1.10-1.99) in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group; the odds for an enlargement less than 20% was higher in women with multiples fibroadenomas (OR = 4.67, 95 % CI: 1.34-16.28). In our study, no serious adverse effect was recorded, and the medicine was well-tolerated by all users. This is the first study that evaluates the effect of MF on the management of fibroadenoma, and the results suggest a favorable effect. Larger studies using higher doses of MF and including a separate design for patients with single or multiple FAs are suggested in order to confirm this effect. This trial (IRCT20100706004329N7) was retrospectively registered on 2018-10-07.",

      "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease characterized by the development of numerous colorectal adenomas in young adults. Metformin, an oral diabetic drug, has been shown to have antineoplastic effects and a favorable safety profile. We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of metformin on the regression of colorectal and duodenal adenoma in patients with FAP. Thirty-four FAP patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive placebo, 500 mg metformin, or 1,500 mg metformin per day orally for 7 months. The number and size of polyps and the global polyp burden were evaluated before and after the intervention. This study was terminated early based on the results of the interim analysis. No significant differences were determined in the percentage change of colorectal and duodenal polyp number over the course of treatment among the three treatment arms (<i>P</i> = 0.627 and <i>P</i> = 1.000, respectively). We found no significant differences in the percentage change of colorectal or duodenal polyp size among the three groups (<i>P</i> = 0.214 and <i>P</i> = 0.803, respectively). The overall polyp burdens of the colorectum and duodenum were not significantly changed by metformin treatment at either dosage. Colon polyps removed from the metformin-treated patients showed significantly lower mTOR signal (p-S6) expression than those from patients in the placebo arm. In conclusion, 7 months of treatment with 500 mg or 1,500 mg metformin did not reduce the mean number or size of polyps in the colorectum or duodenum in FAP patients (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01725490). PREVENTION RELEVANCE: A 7-month metformin treatment (500 mg or 1,500 mg) did not reduce the number or size of polyps in the colorectum or duodenum of FAP patients as compared to placebo. These results do not support the use of metformin to promote regression of intestinal adenomas in FAP patients.",

In addition, selective inhibition of PDE4 enzyme has recently been implicated in the regulation of metabolism with positive effects on glucose homeostasis and weight reduction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast affects body weight and hormonal and metabolic status in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design/Participants/Main Outcome Measures: A 12-week prospective randomized open-label study was conducted with 36 obese women with PCOS diagnosed by the National Eunice Kennedy Shriver Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria that had been pretreated with metformin (MET). They were randomized to MET 1000 mg twice a day or combined treatment (COM) with MET 1000 mg twice a day and roflumilast 500 μg every day. The primary outcome was change in anthropometric measures of obesity. Thirty-one patients (aged 33.8 ± 7.4 y, twice a day 36.4 ± 5.1 kg/m(2), mean ± SD) completed the study: 16 on MET and 15 on COM. Subjects treated with COM lost on average 4.2 ± 2.8 kg compared with a 0.9 ± 2.5 kg weight gain in the MET group (P = .025). Body mass index decreased for 1.6 ± 1.1 kg/m(2) in COM arm compared with increase for 0.9 ± 2.4 kg/m(2) in the MET arm (P = .046). Visceral adipose tissue area as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry decreased from 136.7 ± 37.8 to 121.2 ± 36.2 cm(2) in the COM arm compared with an increase from 155.3 ± 61.9 to 166.7 ± 67.2 cm(2) in the MET arm (P = .02). From baseline to study end, both treatment interventions resulted in a significant reduction of androstenedione (P = .013), free T (P = .002), and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance score (P = .027) and a significant increase in SHBG (P = .024), although the between-treatment differences of the changes have not been statistically significant yet. Roflumilast added to metformin reduced body weight in obese women with PCOS, primarily due to a loss of fat mass.",

A total of 120 renal cancer patients with diabetes mellitus treated in the oncology department of our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were recruited and assigned via random number table method at a ratio of 1 : 1 to receive either metformin (control group) or metformin plus intensive exercise diet therapy (study group) after laparoscopic nephrectomy. Outcome measures included glucose and lipid metabolism, pancreatic islet function, lifestyle, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions. After the intervention, the fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h postprandial blood glucose (PBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of the two groups of patients decreased significantly, and the study group had significantly lower results. After treatment, the two groups had elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting serum insulin (FINS), and homeostasis model assessment of <i>β</i>-cell function (HOMA-<i>β</i>), and higher results were obtained in the study group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). After the intervention, the study group showed higher results of health promoting lifestyle profile-II (HPLP-II) and a 12-month progression-free survival rate than the control group. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. Metformin combined with intensive-exercise diet therapy significantly improves the glucose and lipid metabolism and islet function of renal cancer patients with diabetes and effectively enhances the 12-month progression-free survival. Further trials are, however, required prior to clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer survivors experience problems with cognition that interfere with daily life and can last for years. In the general population, obesity and diabetes are risk factors for cognitive decline, and weight loss can improve cognition; however, the impact of intentional weight loss on cancer survivors' cognition has not been tested. We investigated the impact of weight loss and metformin on changes in cognitive function in a sample of breast cancer survivors. Overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 333) were randomized to a weight loss intervention versus control and metformin versus placebo in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Outcomes were changes in five cognitive domains from baseline to 6 months measured by objective neurocognitive tests. There were no statistically significant intervention effects for the metformin or weight loss interventions in five neurocognitive domains. Baseline body mass index (BMI) was a significant effect modifier of the changes in verbal functioning for the weight loss (P = 0.009) and metformin interventions (P = 0.0125). These effect modifications were independent of percent weight loss achieved during the 6-month study period. This randomized controlled trial of weight loss and metformin interventions that examined changes to cognition among breast cancer survivors suggests that these interventions may not improve cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors in general. However, weight loss may improve verbal functioning among individuals with a higher BMI.",

Obese Chinese women (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with insulin resistance who fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria of PCOS. In group 1, 68 patients administered metformin (1,500 mg/day); in group 2, 67 patients administered rosiglitazone (4 mg/day); in group 3, 69 patients administered metformin (1,000 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 6 months, all with the same diet and regular exercise lifestyle recommendation. Average menstrual interval, anthropometric measurements, androgen-related parameters, and metabolic features of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids, with intention-to-treat analysis. The baseline parameters showed no statistically significant differences. After the 6-month treatment, most participants showed an improved menstrual pattern. There were statistically significant decreases in acne scores, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum testosterone. The metabolic indexes of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids were improved obviously compared with the baseline in each group. Among the three groups, the patients administered 1,500 mg/day metformin experienced greater reductions in weight. However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone alone or combined with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for the women with abnormal lipid profiles.

Knowledge is lacking about the complex interaction between thyroid status and PCOS during pregnancy. We investigated the thyroid status and its association with pregnancy complications in PCOS, and in relation to metformin treatment. <i>Post-hoc</i> analyses of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. 288 pregnant women with PCOS were randomized to treatment with metformin or placebo from first trimester to delivery. We measured serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) at gestational week (gw) 5-12, 19, 32 and 36 and related to metformin treatment and pregnancy complications. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) were analyzed at inclusion and at gw 36. The overall prevalence of subclinical and overt hypothyroidism was 1.5% and 0%, respectively. The TSH level was not affected by metformin, whereas fT4 was significantly higher in the metformin group with less decrease throughout pregnancy compared to placebo, p<0.001. A lower decrease in fT4 during pregnancy correlated to less weight gain (r= -0.17, p=0.020) and tended to be associated with reduced odds ratio for gestational diabetes (OR 0.85 per 1 pmol/L, 95% CI 0.71;1.02). In women with PCOS, metformin treatment during pregnancy was associated with less decrease in fT4 compared to placebo, while it did not affect TSH. A smaller decrease in fT4 correlated to less weight gain and tended to be associated with a lower risk of gestational diabetes.

The NCIC Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) MA.32 investigates effects of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease-free survival and other outcomes in early breast cancer. Maintaining blinding of investigators to outcomes, we conducted a planned, Data Safety Monitoring Committee-approved, analysis of the effect of metformin vs placebo on weight and metabolic factors at six months, including examination of interactions with baseline body mass index (BMI) and insulin, in the first 492 patients with paired blood samples. Eligible nondiabetic subjects with T1-3, N0-3, M0 breast cancer who had completed surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (if given) provided fasting plasma samples at random assignment and at six months. Glucose was measured locally; blood was aliquoted, frozen, and stored at -80°C. Paired plasma aliquots were analyzed for insulin, hs-CRP, and leptin. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and comparisons analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Mean age was 52.1±9.5 years in the metformin group and 52.6 ± 9.8 years in the placebo group. Arms were balanced for estrogen/progesterone receptor, BMI, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and stage. At six months, decreases in weight and blood variables were statistically significantly greater in the metformin arm (vs placebo) in univariate analyses: weight -3.0%, glucose -3.8%, insulin -11.1%, homeostasis model assessment -17.1%, leptin -20.2%, hs-CRP -6.7%; all P values were less than or equal to .03. There was no statistically significant interaction of change in these variables with baseline BMI or insulin. Metformin statistically significantly improved weight, insulin, glucose, leptin, and CRP at six months. Effects did not vary by baseline BMI or fasting insulin.",
