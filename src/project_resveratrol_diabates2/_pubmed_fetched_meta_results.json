      "abstract": "The objective was to determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation and microRNAs expression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 on oral hypoglycemic drugs. This was a randomized, double blinded placebo-controlled parallel group trial. The diabetic patients (n = 110) were randomly assigned either to resveratrol (n = 55) and placebo (55) groups after informed consent and given once daily resveratrol 200 mg and cellulose capsules respectively for 24 weeks. Fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, TNF- α, IL-6, hs-CRP, MDA & circulatory microRNAs were measured at start and end of 24- week intervention. Out of 110 patients recruited, 94 patients completed the study comprising of 45 in resveratrol and 46 in placebo group. The resveratrol supplementation after 24 weeks was resulted in significant reduction [mean difference (95%CI)] of plasma glucose[- 0.50(-0.94 to -0.06)], insulin[- 1.31(-2.24 to -0.38)], homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance[- 0.83(-1.37 to -0.29)], malondialdehyde[- 0.36(-0.61 to -0.11)], high sensitive-C-reactive protein[- 0.35(-0.70 to -0.01)], tumor necrosis factor-alpha[- 1.25(-1.90 to -0.61)] and interleukin-6[- 1.99(-3.29 to -0.69)]. More than two-fold down regulation in miRNA-34a, miRNA-375, miRNA-21, miRNA-192 and up regulation in miRNA-126 and miRNA-132 expression was noted in patients receiving resveratrol as compared to placebo. No side effects were reported during the trial. Resveratrol supplementation contributes in improvement of glycemic control by reducing insulin resistance. It has significant beneficial impact on chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and associated microRNA expression in diabetic patients. Thus, supplementation of resveratrol along with oral hypoglycemic agents may be useful in the reduction of diabetic associated complications.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes, with alarming disability and mortality rates. Ferroptosis plays an essential role in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus and its complications, suggesting that mitigating ferroptosis can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy. Resveratrol (RSV) can promote the angiogenesis of diabetic wounds, but its molecular mechanism is unclear, and RSV has a role in regulating ferroptosis. Therefore, we speculated that RSV could promote the angiogenesis of diabetic wounds and accelerate wound healing by regulating ferroptosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of RSV on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), focusing primarily on cell proliferation and markers associated with ferroptosis. The methods employed included the CCK-8 assay for cell proliferation, ROS determination, Fe²⁺ measurement, scratch and tube formation assays, and transcriptome analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of RSV in promoting wound healing, we established a type 2 diabetes rat model and created a skin injury model. Wound healing rates were assessed, and tissue samples were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Additionally, levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to evaluate oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Upon treatment of HUVECs with AGEs, we observed a decrease in cell viability and induction of ferroptosis. RSV can alleviate ferroptosis in AGEs-treated HUVECs. Further investigation through transcriptome analysis and Western blotting revealed that RSV alleviates ferroptosis in AGE-treated HUVECs by modulating the activity of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In vivo experiments using a diabetic rat skin injury model confirmed that both RSV and Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) enhance wound healing and angiogenesis. This effect was associated with the regulation of ferroptosis marker proteins including GPX4, SLC7A11, and ACSL4. Additionally, in the diabetic rat groups treated with RSV and Fer-1, we noted increased expression of Nrf2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and CD31 proteins compared to the diabetic rat control group. In diabetic wounds, AGEs can lead to ferroptosis in HUVECs. RSV can inhibit AGE-induced ferroptosis in HUVECs, further promoting angiogenesis in diabetic wounds, and ultimately accelerating wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Diminished mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic capacity are associated with reduced longevity. We tested whether resveratrol (RSV), which is known to extend lifespan, impacts mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis. Treatment of mice with RSV significantly increased their aerobic capacity, as evidenced by their increased running time and consumption of oxygen in muscle fibers. RSV's effects were associated with an induction of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and were largely explained by an RSV-mediated decrease in PGC-1alpha acetylation and an increase in PGC-1alpha activity. This mechanism is consistent with RSV being a known activator of the protein deacetylase, SIRT1, and by the lack of effect of RSV in SIRT1(-/-) MEFs. Importantly, RSV treatment protected mice against diet-induced-obesity and insulin resistance. These pharmacological effects of RSV combined with the association of three Sirt1 SNPs and energy homeostasis in Finnish subjects implicates SIRT1 as a key regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Organelle biogenesis is concomitant to organelle inheritance during cell division. It is necessary that organelles double their size and divide to give rise to two identical daughter cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis occurs by growth and division of pre-existing organelles and is temporally coordinated with cell cycle events [1]. However, mitochondrial biogenesis is not only produced in association with cell division. It can be produced in response to an oxidative stimulus, to an increase in the energy requirements of the cells, to exercise training, to electrical stimulation, to hormones, during development, in certain mitochondrial diseases, etc. [2]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is therefore defined as the process via which cells increase their individual mitochondrial mass [3]. Recent discoveries have raised attention to mitochondrial biogenesis as a potential target to treat diseases which up to date do not have an efficient cure. Mitochondria, as the major ROS producer and the major antioxidant producer exert a crucial role within the cell mediating processes such as apoptosis, detoxification, Ca2+ buffering, etc. This pivotal role makes mitochondria a potential target to treat a great variety of diseases. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be pharmacologically manipulated. This issue tries to cover a number of approaches to treat several diseases through triggering mitochondrial biogenesis. It contains recent discoveries in this novel field, focusing on advanced mitochondrial therapies to chronic and degenerative diseases, mitochondrial diseases, lifespan extension, mitohormesis, intracellular signaling, new pharmacological targets and natural therapies. It contributes to the field by covering and gathering the scarcely reported pharmacological approaches in the novel and promising field of mitochondrial biogenesis. There are several diseases that have a mitochondrial origin such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and the Kearns- Sayre syndrome (KSS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS), Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), the syndrome of neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), and Leigh's syndrome. Likewise, other diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a very important role include neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes or cancer. Generally, in mitochondrial diseases a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA leads to a loss of functionality of the OXPHOS system and thus to a depletion of ATP and overproduction of ROS, which can, in turn, induce further mtDNA mutations. The work by Yu-Ting Wu, Shi-Bei Wu, and Yau-Huei Wei (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan) [4] focuses on the aforementioned mitochondrial diseases with special attention to the compensatory mechanisms that prompt mitochondria to produce more energy even under mitochondrial defect-conditions. These compensatory mechanisms include the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis and overexpression of respiratory complex subunits, as well as metabolic shift to glycolysis. The pathways observed to be related to mitochondrial biogenesis as a compensatory adaptation to the energetic deficits in mitochondrial diseases are described (PGC- 1, Sirtuins, AMPK). Several pharmacological strategies to trigger these signaling cascades, according to these authors, are the use of bezafibrate to activate the PPAR-PGC-1α axis, the activation of AMPK by resveratrol and the use of Sirt1 agonists such as quercetin or resveratrol. Other strategies currently used include the addition of antioxidant supplements to the diet (dietary supplementation with antioxidants) such as L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10,MitoQ10 and other mitochondria-targeted antioxidants,N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vitamin C, vitamin E vitamin K1, vitamin B, sodium pyruvate or -lipoic acid. As aforementioned, other diseases do not have exclusively a mitochondrial origin but they might have an important mitochondrial component both on their onset and on their development. This is the case of type 2 diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a peripheral insulin resistance accompanied by an increased secretion of insulin as a compensatory system. Among the explanations about the origin of insulin resistance Mónica Zamora and Josep A. Villena (Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra / Laboratory of Metabolism and Obesity, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain) [5] consider the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction, e.g. impaired (mitochondrial) oxidative capacity of the cell or tissue, is one of the main underlying causes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although this hypothesis is not free of controversy due to the uncertainty on the sequence of events during type 2 diabetes onset, e.g. whether mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of insulin resistance, it has been widely observed that improving mitochondrial function also improves insulin sensitivity and prevents type 2 diabetes. Thus restoring oxidative capacity by increasing mitochondrial mass appears as a suitable strategy to treat insulin resistance. The effort made by researchers trying to understand the signaling pathways mediating mitochondrial biogenesis has uncovered new potential pharmacological targets and opens the perspectives for the design of suitable treatments for insulin resistance. In addition some of the current used strategies could be used to treat insulin resistance such as lifestyle interventions (caloric restriction and endurance exercise) and pharmacological interventions (thiazolidinediones and other PPAR agonists, resveratrol and other calorie restriction mimetics, AMPK activators, ERR activators). Mitochondrial biogenesis is of special importance in modern neurochemistry because of the broad spectrum of human diseases arising from defects in mitochondrial ion and ROS homeostasis, energy production and morphology [1]. Parkinson´s Disease (PD) is a very good example of this important mitochondrial component on neurodegenerative diseases. Anuradha Yadav, Swati Agrawal, Shashi Kant Tiwari, and Rajnish K. Chaturvedi (CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research / Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, India) [6] remark in their review the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD with special focus on the role of oxidative stress and bioenergetic deficits. These alterations may have their origin on pathogenic gene mutations in important genes such as DJ-1, -syn, parkin, PINK1 or LRRK2. These mutations, in turn, may cause defects in mitochondrial dynamics (key events like fission/fusion, biogenesis, trafficking in retrograde and anterograde directions, and mitophagy). This work reviews different strategies to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics in order to ameliorate the neurodegenerative process, with an emphasis on clinical trials reports that indicate their potential. Among them creatine, Coenzyme Q10 and mitochondrial targeted antioxidants/peptides are reported to have the most remarkable effects in clinical trials. They highlight a dual effect of PGC-1α expression on PD prognosis. Whereas a modest expression of this transcriptional co-activator results in positive effects, a moderate to substantial overexpession may have deleterious consequences. As strategies to induce PGC-1α activation, these authors remark the possibility to activate Sirt1 with resveratrol, to use PPAR agonists such as pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, fenofibrate and bezafibrate. Other strategies include the triggering of Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway by triterpenoids (derivatives of oleanolic acid) or by Bacopa monniera, the enhancement of ATP production by carnitine and -lipoic acid. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are the prime source of neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the context of neural differentiation, Martine Uittenbogaard and Anne Chiaramello (Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, USA) [7] thoroughly describe the implication of mitochondrial biogenesis on neuronal differentiation, its timing, its regulation by specific signaling pathways and new potential therapeutic strategies. The maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for neuronal development. A mitochondrial dynamic balance is necessary between mitochondrial fusion, fission and quality control systems and mitochondrial biogenesis. Concerning the signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial biogenesis this review highlights the implication of different regulators such as AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, NRF1, NRF2, Tfam, etc. on the specific case of neuronal development, providing examples of diseases in which these pathways are altered and transgenic mouse models lacking these regulators. A common hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington´s Disease, Alzheimer´s Disease and Parkinson´s Disease) is the impaired function or expression of PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Among the promising strategies to ameliorate mitochondrial-based diseases these authors highlight the induction of PGC-1α via activation of PPAR receptors (rosiglitazone, bezafibrate) or modulating its activity by AMPK (AICAR, metformin, resveratrol) or SIRT1 (SRT1720 and several isoflavone-derived compounds). This article also presents a review of the current animal and cellular models useful to study mitochondriogenesis. Although it is known that many neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases are originated in mitochondria, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis has never been extensively studied.

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects a large part of the adult population and impairs its quality of life. Because of this, natural compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic properties have been used as adjuvants. Among these compounds, resveratrol (RV) stands out, a polyphenol that has been studied in several clinical trials, the results of which are controversial. We conducted a randomized clinical trial on 97 older adults with T2D to evaluate the effect of RV on oxidative stress markers and sirtuin 1, using doses of 1000 mg/day (EG1000, <i>n</i> = 37) and 500 mg/day (EG500, <i>n</i> = 32) compared with a placebo (PG, <i>n</i> = 28). Biochemical markers, oxidative stress and sirtuin 1 levels were measured at baseline and after six months. We observed a statistically significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in total antioxidant capacity, antioxidant gap, the percentage of subjects without oxidant stress and sirtuin 1 levels in EG1000. In the PG, we observed a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in lipoperoxides, isoprostanes and C-reactive protein levels. An increase in the oxidative stress score and in the percentage of subjects with mild and moderate oxidative stress was observed too. Our findings suggest that 1000 mg/day of RV exerts a more efficient antioxidant effect than 500 mg/day.",

      "abstract": "Rosiglitazone (RSG), as an insulin-sensitizing drug to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is reported to decrease bone quality and increase bone fracture risk. The multiple off-target effects of Resveratrol (RSV), a natural specific agonist of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) with pro-osteoblastogenesis and anti-adipogenesis effects, on bone loss in T2DM are still under discussion. In this study, successfully ovariectomized rats were fed with high-fat diet and STZ (HFD/STZ) to induced T2DM mice. RSV alone, RSG alone or co-administration of RSV and RSG were given orally to T2DM rats for 8 weeks to determine whether RSV administration had any prevention effect on T2DM osteoporosis. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow‑derived macrophages (BMMs) were cultured under high glucose condition and were induced to osteoblasts or adipocytes and osteoclasts, respectively. μCT and HE staining showed that in T2DM osteoporotic rats, RSV co-administration prevents RSG induced-bone loss. ELISA results confirmed that RSV suppressed osteoclast activity and promoted osteoblast activity in diabetic osteoporosis rats and RSG-administrated diabetic osteoporosis rats. In vitro study showed that RSV significantly reversed RSG induced inhibition on osteogenesis and promotion on adiopogenesis of BMSC under high glucose (HG). Moreover, RSV significantly reverse RSG induced osteoclast formation and mature under HG. Taken together, these findings uncover a previously unappreciated anti-osteoporosis effect of concomitant treatment with RSV in RSG-administrated diabetic rats, suggesting the clinical use of RSV as an adjuvant in the treatment of T2DM for preventing or reversing RSG administration-associated bone loss.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural phenol that demonstrates a neuroprotective effect, but the bioactivity of Res is low in vivo. Here, chitosan (CS) was cross-linked with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) to encapsulate low water solubility Res. Next, a brain-targeted peptide (TG: TGNYKALHPHNG) was modified on the surface of Res-loaded CS/TPP nanoparticles (TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs) to specifically deliver Res to the brain. Morris water maze results indicated that cognitive impairments were ameliorated by TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs in obesity-related AD mice. Obesity-related insulin resistance promotes Tau phosphorylation and Aβ aggregation in the brain. Administration of TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs alleviated lipid deposition-induced insulin resistance and decreased the level of phosphorylated Tau and Aβ aggregation via the JNK/AKT/GSK3β pathway. Additionally, TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs transported across blood-brain barrier which in turn increased glucose transporter expression levels, antioxidant enzyme activity and inhibited microglial cell activation. Thus, TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs were more effective than Res-CS/TPP-NPs at regulating glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain. Moreover, inflammatory, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress-related gut microbiota including Helicobacter, Colidextribacter, Anaerotruncus, Parasutterella, Allobaculum, Alloprevotella, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium and Candidatus_Saccharimonas were also regulated by TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs. This work indicates the potential use of TG-Res-CS/TPP-NPs for the delivery of Res.",

      "abstract": "Ageing and menopause contribute to endothelial dysfunction, causing impaired cerebral perfusion, which is in turn associated with accelerated cognitive decline. In a 14-week pilot study, we showed that supplementation with low-dose resveratrol, a phytoestrogen that can enhance endothelial function, improved cerebrovascular and cognitive functions in postmenopausal women. We sought to confirm these benefits in a larger, longer-term trial. A 24-month randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was undertaken in 125 postmenopausal women, aged 45-85 years, who took 75 mg trans-resveratrol or placebo twice-daily for 12 months and then crossover to the alternative treatment for another 12 months. We evaluated within individual differences between each treatment period in measures of cognition (primary outcome), cerebrovascular function in the middle cerebral artery (cerebral blood flow velocity: CBFV, cerebrovascular responsiveness: CVR) and cardio-metabolic markers as secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses examined effects of resveratrol by life stages. Compared to placebo, resveratrol supplementation resulted a significant 33% improvement in overall cognitive performance (Cohen's d = 0.170, P = 0.005). Women ≥65 years of age showed a relative improvement in verbal memory with resveratrol compared to those younger than 65 years. Furthermore, resveratrol improved secondary outcomes including resting mean CBFV (d = 0.275, P = 0.001), CVR to hypercapnia (d = 0.307, P = 0.027), CVR to cognitive stimuli (d = 0.259, P = 0.032), fasting insulin (d = 0.174, P = 0.025) and insulin resistance index (d = 0.102, P = 0.034). Regular supplementation with low-dose resveratrol can enhance cognition, cerebrovascular function and insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women. This may translate into a slowing of the accelerated cognitive decline due to ageing and menopause, especially in late-life women. Further studies are warranted to observe whether these cognitive benefits of resveratrol can reduce the risk of dementia.",

Herein, we detected the ability of Res on murine granulosa cells (GCs) against impaired steroidogenesis and apoptotic death in response to high glucose levels. Ovarian GCs were harvested from C57BL/6 mice and cultured in steroidogenic media supplemented with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, 30 ng/mL), Res (50 μmol/L), and low or high glucose concentrations (5 mM or 30 mM). After culture for 24 h, cell supernatants were harvested and the levels of progesterone and estradiol therein were measured. Also, caspase-3 activity and the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and steroidogenesis were assessed. High-glucose treatment suppressed steroidogenesis in this assay system, resulting in the impaired expression of steroidogenesis-related genes including Cyp11a1, Cyp19a1, 3βHSD, and StAR and a concomitant decrease in progesterone and estradiol production. Cells exposed to high glucose also exhibited apoptotic phenotypes characterized by Bax upregulation, Bcl-2 downregulation, and increased caspase-3 activity levels. However, Res treatment was sufficient to reverse this high glucose level-induced apoptotic and steroidogenic phenotypes with improving progesterone and estradiol production, and these maybe related the effects of Res on Cyp11a1, Cyp19a1, 3βHSD, and StAR expressions. These data suggested that Res is well suited to overcoming the negative effects of hyperglycemia of GC functionality.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance serves as \"common soil\" for promoting the development of metabolic diseases; however, the precise pathological factors leading to insulin resistance are not well clarified. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenolic compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, effects and mechanisms of Res on glucose metabolism in adipocytes remain largely unknown. In this study, we show Res treatment significantly increases glucose uptake in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro. Mechanistically, Res up-regulates the protein level of Sirt1 that improves insulin signaling pathway and promotes cellular membrane Glut4 accumulation. Meanwhile, Sirt1 enhances phosphorylation level of AMPK which elevates p-AKT level. Consequently, the transcription factor FOXO1 translocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasm where protein degradation occurs. Therefore, the gene expression of resistin, a direct transcriptional target of FOXO1, is reduced and insulin sensitivity is improved. Importantly, we recapitulate the similar pattern of related protein changes in epididymal adipose tissues of insulin-resistant mice after Res intervention in vivo, reinforcing the hypothesis of Res being involved in regulation of glucose uptake via Sirt1-AMPK axis. Our findings clarify the beneficial effects of Res on glucose transportation in insulin-resistant adipocytes and involved pathway including Sirt1-AMPK, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in the treatment or prevention of insulin-resistance-related metabolic symptoms.",

Blood glucose, plasma triglyceride (TG), body weight and glucose-lipid metabolism of skeletal muscle, fat and liver were examined. We further assessed the metabolic regulation of RSV in C2C12 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 cells of insulin resistance. We found that RSV reduced blood glucose, plasma TG and body weight, ameliorated insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. RSV reduced lipid accumulation and increased glycogen storage in muscle and hepatic cells, promoted lipolysis in adipocytes. We further found RSV reduced ROS levels in muscle, adipose, and hepatic cells of insulin resistance, contributing to improvement of metabolic abnormalities in HFD-fed mice. The study reveals that RSV ameliorates metabolic disorders and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice, which provides further demonstration in RSV-treated type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity (SO), characterized by an excess of fat and a decrease in muscle strength or mass, is a global public health concern and is linked to metabolic conditions such as metabolic syndrome (MetS). Different mechanisms contribute to SO, such as inflammation, fatty acid infiltration, and insulin resistance (IR). Recently, myostatin (MYOST), an inhibitory factor for skeletal muscle tissue, was proposed as an aimed compound for the treatment of conditions of muscular metabolic imbalance mass and MetS. On the other hand, a therapy with natural compounds such as resveratrol (R) and quercetin (Q) is effective for the treatment of MetS, but its effect on the MYOST pathway has been poorly explored. The control group received water, and the MetS group received 30% commercial sugar in the drinking water for 6 months. Polyphenol mix (R at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day and Q at 0.95 mg/kg/day) was administered for 1 month. MetS rats present SO linked to an increase in the expression of MYOST/ActRIIA and ActRIIB (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). R+Q treatment prevented SO by lowering the expression of MYOST and its receptors and increased the expression of Smad 7 in MetS rats (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Moreover, the polyphenol treatment reverted IR by increasing Akt phosphorylation, leading to an increase in muscle mass. It decreased lipid stores, restored glycogen accumulation, and increased myosin expression (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The results of this work indicate that R+Q supplementation could be a promising therapeutic agent to prevent SO and sarcopenia derived from other metabolic alterations.",

Promoting BAT-like features in white adipose (WAT) is an attractive, if elusive, therapeutic approach to staunch the current obesity epidemic. Here we report that gain of function of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SirT1 or loss of function of its endogenous inhibitor Deleted in breast cancer-1 (Dbc1) promote \"browning\" of WAT by deacetylating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar)-γ on Lys268 and Lys293. SirT1-dependent deacetylation of Lys268 and Lys293 is required to recruit the BAT program coactivator Prdm16 to Pparγ, leading to selective induction of BAT genes and repression of visceral WAT genes associated with insulin resistance. An acetylation-defective Pparγ mutant induces a brown phenotype in white adipocytes, whereas an acetylated mimetic fails to induce \"brown\" genes but retains the ability to activate \"white\" genes. We propose that SirT1-dependent Pparγ deacetylation is a form of selective Pparγ modulation of potential therapeutic import.",

This study investigated RSV's impact on molecular pathways in an experimental model of diabetes in cardiac and skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. Wistar rats were assigned to control (C), control treated with RSV (RC), diabetic (D), and diabetic treated with RSV (RD). Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin and nicotinamide, and RSV was administered for six weeks. In diabetic rats, RSV treatment significantly reduced collagen accumulation in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues compared to untreated diabetic controls, although it did not restore muscle mass. Adipose tissue in diabetic rats exhibited a significant reduction of 3.4 times in collagen levels following RSV treatment. However, this reduction was not associated with any measurable improvement in tissue function. In cardiac tissue, RSV downregulated phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT)/AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6)/rpS6 while mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity remained unchanged. In skeletal muscle, RSV suppressed rpS6 phosphorylation without affecting (mTOR) signaling. RSV enhanced mTOR and Beclin-1 expression in adipose tissue, though metabolic dysfunction persisted. RSV reduced receptors for advanced glycation end-product expression in all tissues, indicating the modulation of hyperglycemia-driven pathways. RSV improved fibrosis and signaling pathways but failed to reverse abnormal tissue growth patterns, including cardiac hypertrophy, skeletal muscle atrophy, and adipose tissue atrophy.",

      "abstract": "The role of inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) is significant in the progression and development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Resveratrol (Res) has various pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-OS. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor (TRAF3) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-OS effects in a variety of diseases. This study investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects of Res, with a special focus on the regulation of TRAF3 in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. A high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) was used to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rat model, and a high glucose (HG, 30 mmol/L)-treated glomerular thylakoid cell model was established in HBZY-1 rats. Res (40 mg/kg/day) was studied in vivo by gavage for 8 weeks and in vitro by treatment with Res (25, 50, and 100 μmol/L) for 48 hours. The degree of renal injury was evaluated by blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood creatinine (Cr) and urine protein. Renal structure and glycogen changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff staining (PAS). Inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1βt IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoblotting was performed to detect TRAF3, TLR4, MyD88, phosphorylated (p)-IκBβ, p-p65, and p65. Protein blotting was applied for final mechanistic validation using lentiviral transfection of diabetes mellitus (DM) rats and high glucose-induced cells against TRAF3. As a result Res effectively ameliorated renal loss and renal histopathologic changes in DM rats, as evidenced by decreased BUN (P<0.01), Cr (P<0.01), urine protein (P<0.01), and renal structural lesions and reduced basement membrane glycogen (P<0.015). In terms of molecular mechanisms, Res was able to significantly promote the expression of TRAF3, which in turn inhibited the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α (all P<0.01), thereby attenuating inflammatory responses in the kidney. In addition, Res significantly reduced OS in renal tissues and in the HG cell model, such as increasing SOD and CAT activities and decreasing MDA levels (all P<0.05). Silencing of TRAF3, on the other hand, partially reduced the anti-inflammatory and anti-OS effects of Res and activated the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. To sum up Res can alleviate DN by attenuating inflammation and OS, and the underlying mechanisms are related to TRAF3 in the TLR4/NF-κB-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway.",

      "abstract": "Progressive microvascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may impair the ability of cerebral vessels to supply blood to brain regions during local metabolic demand, thereby increasing risks of dementia. Having previously demonstrated that resveratrol can enhance vasodilator function in the systemic circulation, we hypothesised that resveratrol could similarly benefit the cerebral circulation. We aimed to determine the most efficacious dose of resveratrol to improve cerebral vasodilator responsiveness (CVR) in T2DM. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover intervention, 36 dementia-free, non-insulin dependent T2DM older adults (49-78 years old) consumed single doses of synthetic trans-resveratrol (0, 75, 150, and 300 mg) at weekly intervals. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess CVR to a hypercapnic stimulus, both before and 45 min after treatment. CVR, measured bilaterally in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA), was expressed as the percentage change in mean blood flow velocity from baseline to the peak velocity attained during hypercapnia. Resveratrol consumption increased CVR in the MCA; mean within-individual changes for each dose from placebo were 13.8 ± 3.5% for 75 mg (P = 0.001), 8.9 ± 3.5% for 150 mg (P = 0.016), and 13.7 ± 3.3% for 300 mg (P < 0.001); only the 75 mg dose was efficacious in the PCA (13.2 ± 4.5%, P = 0.016). Our results provide the first clinical evidence of an acute enhancement of vasodilator responsiveness in cerebral vessels following consumption of resveratrol in this population who are known to have endothelial dysfunction and sub-clinical cognitive impairment. Importantly, maximum improvement was observed with the lowest dose used. ACTRN12614000891628 (www.anzctr.org.au).",

      "abstract": "Phenolic compounds have emerged in recent years as an option to face insulin resistance and diabetes. The central aim of this study was: (1) to demonstrate that physiological doses of resveratrol (RSV) or quercetin (Q) can influence glucose metabolism in human myotubes, (2) to establish whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase B -PKB- (Akt) pathways are involved in this effect. In addition, the effects of these polyphenols on mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation were analysed. Myotubes from healthy donors were cultured for 24 h with either 0.1 μM of RSV or with 10 μM of Q. Glucose metabolism, such as glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and lactate production, were measured with D[U-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose. β-oxidation using [1-<sup>14</sup>C]palmitate as well as the expression of key metabolic genes and proteins by Real Time PCR and Western blot were also assessed. Although RSV and Q increased pgc1α expression, they did not significantly change either glucose oxidation or β-oxidation. Q increased AMPK, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and AS160 phosphorylation in basal conditions and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β) in insulin-stimulated conditions. RSV tended to increase the phosphorylation rates of AMPK and GSK3β. Both of the polyphenols increased insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and reduced lactate production in human myotubes. Thus, physiological doses of RSV or Q may exhibit anti-diabetic actions in human myotubes.",

      "abstract": "Endocrine disorders have become more and more frequently diagnosed in humans and animals. In horses, equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is characterized by insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation and usually by pathological obesity. Due to an increased inflammatory response in the adipose tissue, cytophysiological properties of adipose derived stem cells (ASC) have been impaired, which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondria deterioration and accelerated ageing of those cells affect their multipotency and restrict the effectiveness of the differentiation process. In the present study, we have treated ASC isolated from EMS individuals with a combination of 5-azacytydine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) in order to reverse their aged phenotype and enhance osteogenic differentiation. Using SEM and confocal microscope, cell morphology, matrix mineralization and mitochondrial dynamics were assessed. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of osteogenic-related genes with RT-PCR. We also investigated the role of autophagy during differentiation and silenced PARKIN expression with siRNA. Obtained results indicated that AZA/RES significantly enhanced early osteogenesis of ASC derived from EMS animals. Increased matrix mineralization, RUNX-2, collagen type I and osteopontin levels were noted. Furthermore, we proved that AZA/RES exerts its beneficial effects by modulating autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics through PARKIN and RUNX-2 activity.",

This study aimed to investigate if pterostilbene (PTE) regulates glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, as well as its potential mechanism in the context of AGEs exposure. In vitro, Lo2 and HepG2 cells are treated with vehicle, AGEs with or without PTE. AGEs exposure directly impair insulin action as evidenced by assays of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, consumption, and output. However, PTE efficiently rescue the AGE-induced phenotypes in both cell lines, and enhance IRS-1/PI3K/AKT insulin signaling in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, C57BL6 mice are fed with regular, high AGEs diet and high AGEs plus PTE. PTE administration effectively improves hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, and impaired hepatic insulin signaling induced by AGEs, consistent with the in vitro experiments. Moreover, PTE reduce AGEs accumulation in liver and serum. RNA-seq data indicate that PTE counteracts several AGEs-induced dysfunctions including diabetes related process, glucose metabolic process, immune response, and so on. PTE treatment prominently reduced AGEs accumulation and alleviated AGEs-associated diabetes symptoms. PTE could be used as a promising glucose-sensitizing agent for nutritional intervention.",

In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, we treated older glucose-intolerant adults (n = 30) with resveratrol (2-3 g/daily) or placebo, each for 6 weeks. A standard mixed-meal test was used to assess insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and secretion (C-peptide deconvolution) and vascular function by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained for gene expression using RNA-Seq analysis and to assess mitochondrial morphology. There were no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, weight, blood pressure, or lipid profile following resveratrol treatment. Fasting reactive hyperemia index improved with resveratrol (2.02 ± 0.2 vs 1.76 ± 0.02, p = .002). RNA-Seq analysis yielded 140 differentially expressed transcripts (corrected p-value ≤ .05), predominantly associated with mitochondrial genes and noncoding RNA. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed that mitochondrial dysfunction (p = 2.77 × 10-12) and oxidative phosphorylation (p = 1.41 × 10-11) were the most significantly perturbed pathways. Mitochondrial number, but not size, was increased. Resveratrol treatment of older adults with impaired glucose regulation may have beneficial effects on vascular function, but not glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. Changes in gene expression suggest effects similar to those observed with caloric restriction, which has been shown to increase life and health span in animal models, although its significance for humans is uncertain. Future human studies should address the appropriate dose range and low bioavailability of resveratrol.",

The content of naturally occurring cis-THSG (cis-2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene 2-O-β-glucopyranoside) was very low in PM root, but was prepared in this study by mimicking the traditional process of PM. The anti-diabetic effects of trans- and cis-THSG were evaluated in T2D to search for more efficacious food ingredient(s). Trans-THSG was chromatographically purified from PM roots and cis-THSG was prepared with our innovative process via exposure of trans-THSG to UV-light. The anti-diabetic effects of both THSGs were tested with HFD-induced male CF-1 diabetic mice. Cis-THSG was found more effective than trans-THSG in hypoglycemic effect and in ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. In HepG2 cells, cis-THSG also demonstrated more potent activity than trans-THSG in suppressing transcription of phosphoenopyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Cis-THSG can be an enriched bioactive ingredient in PM roots from post-processing and is significantly more effective against hyperglycemia than trans-THSG.

FFA activate protein kinases including the proinflammatory IκBα kinase β (IKKβ), leading to serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and impaired insulin signaling. To test whether resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, prevents FFA-induced insulin resistance, we used a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a tracer to assess hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in overnight-fasted Wistar rats infused for 7 h with saline, Intralipid plus 20 U·mL(-1) heparin (IH; triglyceride emulsion that elevates FFA levels in vivo; 5.5 μL·min(-1)) with or without resveratrol (3 mg·kg(-1)·h(-1)), or resveratrol alone. Infusion of IH significantly decreased glucose infusion rate (GIR; P < 0.05) and peripheral glucose utilization (P < 0.05) and increased endogenous glucose production (EGP; P < 0.05) during the clamp compared with saline infusion. Resveratrol co-infusion, however, completely prevented the effects induced by IH infusion: it prevented the decreases in GIR (P < 0.05 vs. IH), peripheral glucose utilization (P < 0.05 vs. IH), and insulin-induced suppression of EGP (P < 0.05 vs. IH). Resveratrol alone had no effect. Furthermore, IH infusion increased serine (307) phosphorylation of IRS-1 in soleus muscle (∼30-fold, P < 0.001), decreased total IRS-1 levels, and decreased IκBα content, consistent with activation of IKKβ. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished by resveratrol (P < 0.05 vs. IH). These results suggest that resveratrol prevents FFA-induced hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and, therefore, may help mitigate the health consequences of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol exhibits a pleiotropic, favorable action under various pathological conditions, including type 2 diabetes. However, its anti-diabetic effects in animal models and human trials have not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to determine whether resveratrol is capable of inducing beneficial changes in the Goto-Kakizaki rat, a spontaneous model of diabetes, which in several aspects is similar to type 2 diabetes in humans. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and control Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated intragastrically with resveratrol (20 mg/kg b.w./day) for 10 weeks. Then, a glucose tolerance test was performed and levels of some adipokines in blood were measured. Moreover, lipid contents in skeletal muscle and liver tissues, along with the expression and phosphorylation of pivotal enzymes (AMP-activated protein kinase-AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-ACC, protein kinase B-Akt) in these tissues were determined. Histology of pancreatic islets was also compared. GK rats non-treated with resveratrol displayed a marked glucose intolerance and had increased lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle. Moreover, upregulation of the expression and phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC and Akt was shown in the muscle tissue of GK rats. Those rats also had an abnormal structure of pancreatic islets compared with control animals. However, treatment with resveratrol improved glucose tolerance and prevented lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle of GK rats. This effect was associated with a substantial normalization of expression and phosphorylation of ACC and Akt. In GK rats subjected to resveratrol therapy, the structure of pancreatic islets was also clearly improved. Moreover, blood adiponectin and leptin levels were partially normalized by resveratrol in GK rats. It was revealed that resveratrol ameliorates key symptoms of diabetes in GK rats. This compound improved glucose tolerance, which was largely linked to beneficial changes in skeletal muscle. Resveratrol also positively affected pancreatic islets. Our new findings show that resveratrol has therapeutic potential in GK rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is rising, presumably because of a coexisting pandemic of obesity. Since diabetic neuropathy and neuroinflammation are frequent and significant complications of both prolonged hyperglycemia and iatrogenic hypoglycemia, the effect of glucose concentration and resveratrol (RSV) supplementation on cytokine profile was assessed in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MATERIAL AND METHODS The in vitro model of BBB was formed of endothelial cells and astrocytes, which represented the microvascular and brain compartments (MC and BC, respectively). The BC concentrations of selected cytokines - IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, TNF-alpha, IFN-γ, GM-CSF in response to different glucose concentrations in the MC were studied. The influence of LPS in the BC and RSV in the MC on the cytokine profile in the BC was examined. RESULTS Low glucose concentration (40 mg/dL) in the MC resulted in increased concentration of all the cytokines in the BC except TNF-alpha, compared to normoglycemia-imitating conditions (90 mg/dL) (P<0.05). High glucose concentration (450 mg/dL) in the MC elevated the concentration of all the cytokines in the BC (P<0.05). RSV decreased the level of all cytokines in the BC after 24 h following its administration for all glucose concentrations in the MC (P<0.02). The greatest decline was observed in normoglycemic conditions (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Both hypo- and hyperglycemia-simulating conditions impair the cytokine profile in BC, while RSV can normalize it, despite relatively poor penetration through the BBB. RSV exhibits anti-neuroinflammatory effects, especially in the group with normoglycemia-simulating conditions.",

      "abstract": "Endothelial senescence plays crucial roles in diabetic vascular complication. Recent evidence indicated that transient hyperglycaemia could potentiate persistent diabetic vascular complications, a phenomenon known as \"metabolic memory.\" Although SIRT1 has been demonstrated to mediate high glucose-induced endothelial senescence, whether and how \"metabolic memory\" would affect endothelial senescence through SIRT1 signaling remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the involvement of SIRT1 axis as well as the protective effects of resveratrol (RSV) and metformin (MET), two potent SIRT1 activators, during the occurrence of \"metabolic memory\" of cellular senescence (senescent \"memory\"). Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in either normal glucose (NG)/high glucose (HG) media for 6 days, or 3 days of HG followed by 3 days of NG (HN), with or without RSV or MET treatment. It was shown that HN incubation triggered persistent downregulation of deacetylase SIRT1 and upregulation of acetyltransferase p300, leading to sustained hyperacetylation (at K382) and activation of p53, and subsequent p53/p21-mediated senescent \"memory.\" In contrast, senescent \"memory\" was abrogated by overexpression of SIRT1 or knockdown of p300. Interestingly, we found that SIRT1 and p300 could regulate each other in response to HN stimulation, suggesting that a delicate balance between acetyltransferases and deacetylases may be particularly important for sustained acetylation and activation of non-histone proteins (such as p53), and eventually the occurrence of \"metabolic memory.\" Furthermore, we found that RSV or MET treatment prevented senescent \"memory\" by modulating SIRT1/p300/p53/p21 pathway. Notably, early and continuous treatment of MET, but not RSV, was particularly important for preventing senescent \"memory.\" In conclusion, short-term high glucose stimulation could induce sustained endothelial senescence via SIRT1/p300/p53/p21 pathway. RVS or MET treatment could enhance SIRT1-mediated signaling and thus protect against senescent \"memory\" independent of their glucose lowering mechanisms. Therefore, they may serve as promising therapeutic drugs against the development of \"metabolic memory.\"",

      "abstract": "Host-modulation therapy is generally accepted as a novel promising method for diabetic periodontitis (DP) treatment and screening an appropriate drug model is the key to success. Resveratrol (RSV), because of its viable antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to control glucose metabolism, is considered a potential candidate. However, poor water solubility, rapid decomposition and short serum half-life period significantly limit its application. Therefore, in this study, we designed a RSV-grafted mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN-RSV) drug carrier system to enhance RSV's stability effectively and prolong its duration. Further analyses have verified the indispensable role of MSNs in improving the bioavailability of RSV, which could result in a more favorable therapeutic efficacy in DP related to regulating the polarization of the macrophage. The reason for this could be explained by activating the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting the NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling pathway. This study also focused on the auxiliary effect of MSN-RSV on alleviating insulin resistance (IR) and controlling glucose metabolism. In brief, the study has provided a potential alternative strategy for DP therapy. It is also helpful for future intensive research topics like the immunoregulatory mechanisms in the bidirectional relationship between diabetes and periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity and lowers hepatic glucose production (HGP) in rat models of obesity and diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms for these antidiabetic effects remain elusive. One process that is considered a key feature of resveratrol action is the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in various tissues. However, the low bioavailability of resveratrol raises questions about whether the antidiabetic effects of oral resveratrol can act directly on these tissues. We show here that acute intraduodenal infusion of resveratrol reversed a 3 d high fat diet (HFD)-induced reduction in duodenal-mucosal Sirt1 protein levels while also enhancing insulin sensitivity and lowering HGP. Further, we found that duodenum-specific knockdown of Sirt1 expression for 14 d was sufficient to induce hepatic insulin resistance in rats fed normal chow. We also found that the glucoregulatory role of duodenally acting resveratrol required activation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) in this tissue to initiate a gut-brain-liver neuronal axis that improved hypothalamic insulin sensitivity and in turn, reduced HGP. In addition to the effects of duodenally acting resveratrol in an acute 3 d HFD-fed model of insulin resistance, we also found that short-term infusion of resveratrol into the duodenum lowered HGP in two other rat models of insulin resistance--a 28 d HFD-induced model of obesity and a nicotinamide (NA)-streptozotocin (STZ)-HFD-induced model of mild type 2 diabetes. Together, these studies highlight the therapeutic relevance of targeting duodenal SIRT1 to reverse insulin resistance and improve glucose homeostasis in obesity and diabetes.",

An emphasis was on identifying mechanisms of resveratrol action upon distinct structure of the individual PCB congener-planar dioxin-like PCB 77 and non-planar di-ortho-substituted PCB 153. Multiple toxicity endpoint analysis was performed. Cell viability/proliferation was assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion method, Neutral Red, Kenacid Blue, and MTT bioassays. The level of oxidative stress was measured by fluorescent probes, and flow cytometry was applied to evaluate the mode of cell death. Resveratrol applied alone did not affect cell proliferation and viability in doses up to 20 µM, although significant antioxidative activity was observed. Toxic effects of ortho-PCB 153 (cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death) were mitigated by resveratrol. On the contrary pre-incubation with resveratrol did not result in cell viability protection when planar PCB 77 was applied. This indicates that resveratrol efficacy may be linked to specific structure of the individual congener, suggesting nutritional modulation of environmental insults caused by ortho-PCBs. We point out the importance of resveratrol dosage considering that synergistic cytotoxic effect with both PCB congeners is observed at concentrations ≥ 10 μM.",

Serum glucose, copper, zinc, SOD activity, total oxidant status (TOS) as well as thiol groups were all measured. Blood glucose in RSV treated groups significantly decreased. Similarly, copper significantly decreased in diabetic groups treated with RSV. Treatment with 10 mg/kg RSV resulted in significantly increased serum zinc. Furthermore, Cu/Zn ratio was observed to decrease in treated groups compared with untreated diabetic control group. RSV treated groups revealed an increased level of SOD activity as well as improved oxidative status. In summary, the results showed that RSV has potential hypoglycemic effect, attenuates trace element homeostasis, and consequently increases SOD activity level.",

In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial 192 T2DM outpatients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500 mg/day (Resv500 arm), resveratrol 40 mg/day (Resv40 arm) or placebo for 6 months.

Whole-body BMD significantly decreased in the placebo group, while whole-body BMC decreased in both the placebo and Resv40 arms. No significant changes in BMD and BMC values occurred in the Resv500 arm. The adjusted mean differences of change from baseline were significantly different in the Resv500 arm vs placebo for whole-body BMD (0.01 vs -0.03 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.001), whole-body BMC (4.04 vs -58.8 g, p < 0.001), whole-body T-score (0.15 vs -0.26), and serum phosphorus (0.07 vs -0.01 µmol/L, p = 0.002). In subgroup analyses, in Resv500 treated-patients BMD values increased to higher levels in those with lower calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D values, and in alcohol drinkers. Supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol prevented bone density loss in patients with T2DM, in particular, in those with unfavorable conditions at baseline.",

      "abstract": "Maternal resveratrol (RESV) administration in gestational diabetes (GDM) restored normoglycaemia and insulin secretion. GDM-induced obesity was prevented in male GDM+RESV offspring but not in females. GDM+RESV offspring exhibited improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. GDM+RESV restored hepatic glucose homeostasis in offspring. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was enhanced in GDM+RESV offspring. Gestational diabetes (GDM), the most common complication of pregnancy, is associated with adverse metabolic health outcomes in offspring. Using a rat model of diet-induced GDM, we investigated whether maternal resveratrol (RESV) supplementation (147 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>  day<sup>-1</sup> ) in the third week of pregnancy could improve maternal glycaemia and protect the offspring from developing metabolic dysfunction. Female Sprague-Dawley rats consumed a high-fat and sucrose (HFS) diet to induce GDM. Lean controls consumed a low-fat (LF) diet. In the third trimester, when maternal hyperglycaemia was observed, the HFS diet was supplemented with RESV. At weaning, offspring were randomly assigned a LF or HFS diet until 15 weeks of age. In pregnant dams, RESV restored glucose tolerance, normoglycaemia and improved insulin secretion. At 15 weeks of age, GDM+RESV-HFS male offspring were less obese than the GDM-HFS offspring. By contrast, the female GDM+RESV-HFS offspring were similarly as obese as the GDM-HFS group. Hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and dysregulated gluconeogenesis were observed in the male GDM offspring and were attenuated in the offspring of GDM+RESV dams. The dysregulation of several metabolic genes (e.g. ppara, lpl, pepck and g6p) in the livers of GDM offspring was attenuated in the GDM+RESV offspring group. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was also improved in the islets from offspring of GDM+RESV dams. Thus, maternal RESV supplementation during the third trimester of pregnancy and lactation induced several beneficial metabolic health outcomes for both mothers and offspring. Therefore, RESV could be an alternative to current GDM treatments.",

      "abstract": "The polyphenol compound resveratrol (RSV) has attracted attention due to its reputed beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. Our lab has previously identified protective effects of RSV against the development of type 2 diabetes in rats. These effects occurred in a manner similar to thiazolidinedione's (TZDs), a class of insulin sensitizing drugs. TZDs are commonly prescribed in combination with metformin (MET) and thus we sought to examine the combined effects of RSV and MET in treating insulin resistance. Male C57BL6 mice were fed a low- (LFD; 10% Kcal from fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% Kcal from fat) for 9 weeks to induce glucose and insulin intolerance. HFD mice were then assigned to control (HFD), MET (231.28 ± 12.24 mg/kg/day), RSV (93.68 ± 3.51 mg/kg/day), or combined (COM; MET 232.01 ± 17.12 mg/kg/day and RSV 92.77 ± 6.92 mg/kg/day) treatment groups. Changes in glucose and insulin tolerance and tissue-specific insulin signaling were measured 4 weeks post-treatment. RSV or MET alone did not have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, although MET significantly improved insulin tolerance compared to HFD Glucose and insulin tolerance were significantly improved in COM compared to HFD and this was mirrored by enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in triceps muscle and inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue in COM compared to HFD mice. Improvements with COM treatment were not explained by differences in body weight, adiposity, or markers of adipose tissue inflammation. In summary, this study provides evidence of beneficial effects of combined RSV and MET therapy in treating impairments in glucose homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which is associated with the improvement of metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes, is a well-known longevity-related gene. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the known protective effects of SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol and SRT1720, on diabetes- or obesity-induced fatty liver and insulin resistance. Here, we newly synthesized 18 benzoxazole hydrochloride derivatives based on the structure of resveratrol and SRT1720. We performed an in vitro SIRT1 activity assay to identify the strongest SIRT1 activator. The assay confirmed MHY2233 to be the strongest SIRT1 activator (1.5-fold more potent than resveratrol), and docking simulation showed that the binding affinity of MHY2233 was higher than that of resveratrol and SRT1720. To investigate its beneficial effects, db/db mice were orally administered MHY2233 for 1 month, and various metabolic parameters were assessed in the serum and liver tissues. MHY2233 markedly ameliorated insulin signaling without affecting body weight in db/db mice. In particular, the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes, such as acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein, which increased in db/db mice, decreased following oral treatment with MHY2233. In conclusion, the novel SIRT1 activator MHY2233 reduced lipid accumulation and improved insulin resistance. This finding may contribute toward therapeutic approaches for fatty liver disease and glucose tolerance.",

      "abstract": "Recently, metabolic syndrome (MS) has gained attention in human and animal metabolic medicine. Insulin resistance, inflammation, hyperleptinemia, and hyperinsulinemia are critical to its definition. MS is a complex cluster of metabolic risk factors that together exert a wide range of effects on multiple organs, tissues, and cells in the body. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are multipotent stem cell population residing within the adipose tissue that is inflamed during MS. Studies have indicated that these cells lose their stemness and multipotency during MS, which strongly reduces their therapeutic potential. They suffer from oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial deterioration. Thus, the aim of this study was to rejuvenate these cells <i>in vitro</i> in order to improve their chondrogenic differentiation effectiveness. Pharmacotherapy of ASCs was based on resveratrol and 5-azacytidine pretreatment. We evaluated whether those substances are able to reverse aged phenotype of metabolic syndrome-derived ASCs and improve their chondrogenic differentiation at its early stage using immunofluorescence, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. Obtained results indicated that 5-azacytidine and resveratrol modulated mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, and ER stress, leading to the enhancement of chondrogenesis in metabolically impaired ASCs. Therefore, pretreatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine and resveratrol may become a necessary intervention before clinical application of these cells in order to strengthen their multipotency and therapeutic potential.",

The consequences of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a commonly consumed form of fructose and glucose, have poorly been examined. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether HFCS intake (10% and 20% beverages for 12 weeks) impacts vascular reactivity to insulin and endothelin-1 in conjunction with insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA/proteins levels in aorta of rats. At challenge, we tested the effectiveness of resveratrol (28-30 mg/kg body weight/day) on outcomes of HFCS feeding. HFCS (20%) diet feeding increased plasma triglyceride, VLDL, cholesterol, insulin and glucose levels, but not body weights of rats. Impaired nitric oxide-mediated relaxation to insulin (10⁻⁹ to 3×10⁻⁶ M), and enhanced contraction to endothelin-1 (10⁻¹¹ to 10⁻⁸ M) were associated with decreased expression of IRS-1 and eNOS mRNA and protein, but increased expression of iNOS, in aortas of rats fed with HFCS. Resveratrol supplementation restored many features of HFCS-induced disturbances, probably by regulating eNOS and iNOS production. In conclusion, dietary HFCS causes vascular insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction through attenuating IRS-1 and eNOS expressions as well as increasing iNOS in rats. Resveratrol has capability to recover HFCS-induced disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is currently the fifth leading cause of death by disease in the USA. The underlying mechanisms for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) and the enhanced susceptibility of such patients to inflammatory disorders and infections remain to be fully defined. We have recently shown that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-diabetic people upregulate expression of inflammatory genes in response to proteasome modulators, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and soybean lectin (LEC); in contrast, resveratrol (RES) downregulates this response. We hypothesized that LPS and LEC will also elicit a similar upregulation of gene expression of key signaling mediators in (PBMCs) from people with type 2 diabetes (PwD2, with chronic inflammation) ex vivo. Unexpectedly, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we show for the first time, that PBMCs from PwD2 failed to elicit a robust LPS- and LEC-induced gene expression of proteasome subunit LMP7 (<i>PSMB8</i>) and mediators of T cell signaling that were observed in non-diabetic controls. These repressed genes included: <i>PSMB8</i>, <i>PSMB9</i>, interferon-γ, interferon-<i>λ,</i> signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription-1 (<i>STAT1</i>), human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA DQB1</i>, <i>HLA DQA1</i>) molecules, interleukin 12A, tumor necrosis factor-α, transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (<i>TAP1</i>), and several others, which showed a markedly weak upregulation with toxins in PBMCs from PwD2, as compared to those from non-diabetics. Resveratrol (proteasome inhibitor) further downregulated the gene expression of these inflammatory mediators in PBMCs from PwD2. These results might explain why PwD2 may be susceptible to infectious disease. LPS and toxins may be leading to inflammation, insulin resistance, and thus, metabolic changes in the host cells.",

However, data obtained from human subjects concerning this putative relation indicate that the mitochondrial defect observed in diabetic muscle might be secondary to the insulin-resistant state instead of being a causal factor. Nonetheless, diminished mitochondrial function, even secondary to insulin resistance, may accelerate lipid deposition in non-adipose tissues and aggravate insulin resistance. Indeed, improving mitochondrial capacity via exercise training and calorie restriction is associated with positive metabolic health effects. Here we review muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in humans and propose that targeting muscle mitochondria to improve muscle oxidative capacity should be considered as a strategy for improving metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "Limitations and side effects associated with current anti-diabetic treatments have necessitated the search for new therapeutic alternatives. This study aimed to explore the combined use of resveratrol (RVT) and established anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone (PGZ) against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM). STZ was supplemented daily to Sprague-Dawley rats to induce DM. The synergistic effect of the RVT (20 mg/kg) and PGZ (0.65 mg/kg) on DM complications was evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment. Biochemical analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of our treatment on glucose level, insulin sensitivity, lipid disturbances, oxidative mediators and inflammatory markers. STZ induced DM onset that is accompanied with elevated diabetic markers, lipid disturbances, remarkable oxidative damage and hyper-inflammation. The PGZ+RVT combination has the best effect as illustrated by significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels. This combination attenuated (p < 0.05) lipid disturbances and their associated elevated atherogenic biomarkers. At the same time, treatments with PGZ+RVT exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect as it attenuated the increase in inflammatory parameters (CRP, TNF-α, IL-6). Also, it restored total antioxidant capacity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARg) levels that decreased by STZ-DM induction. This study provides PGZ+RVT as promising DM therapeutic alternative. This synergistic combination alleviates most of DM-related complications and insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle, a highly metabolic tissue, is particularly vulnerable to increased levels of saturated free fatty acids (FFAs). The role of autophagy in saturated FFAs-induced cellular senescence and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Therefore, the present study was aimed to explore autophagic flux in cellular senescence and insulin resistance induced by palmitate in muscle cells, and whether resveratrol limited these responses. Our results showed that palmitate induced cellular senescence in both myoblasts and myotubes. In addition, palmitate delayed differentiation in myoblasts and inhibited expression of insulin-stimulated p-AKTSer473 in myotubes. The accumulations of autophagosome assessed by tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 demonstrated that autophagic flux was impaired in both palmitate-treated myoblasts and myotubes. Resveratrol protected muscle cells from palmitate-induced cellular senescence, apoptosis during differentiation, and insulin resistance via ameliorating autophagic flux. The direct influence of autophagic flux on development of cellular senescence and insulin resistance was confirmed by blockage of autophagic flux with chloroquine. In conclusion, impairment of autophagic flux is crucial for palmitate-induced cellular senescence and insulin resistance in muscle cells. Restoring autophagic flux by resveratrol could be a promising approach to prevent cellular senescence and ameliorate insulin resistance in muscle.",

This study was designed to explore the potential mechanism by which resveratrol ameliorated ethanol-induced insulin resistance, focusing on its regulations on the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> /NADH and SIRT1 expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either control or ethanol liquid diets containing 0.8, 1.6 and 2.4 g/kg·bw ethanol with or without 100 mg/kg·bw resveratrol for 22 weeks.

In primary rat hepatocytes, ethanol exposure (25 mmol/L, 24 h) similarly decreased SIRT1 expression and NAD<sup>+</sup> /NADH ratio (33%, P < 0.05; 32%, P < 0.01), and 0.1 μmol/L resveratrol treatment reversed these decreases and inhibited the expressions of ADH and CYP2E1.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of resveratrol on sperm parameters and chromatin quality in experimentally induced type 2 diabetes by streptozotocin and nicotinamide. Forty male adult Wistar rats were grouped into normal control, diabetic control and resveratrol-treated diabetic groups (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg orally treated for 30 days). Type 2 diabetes was induced using a single dose of streptozotocin and nicotinamide by intraperitoneal injection. Then, the different parameters and chromatin condensation of the epididymal extracted spermatozoon were studied using aniline blue (AB), acridine orange (AO) and toluidine blue (TB) staining. The sperm parameters including count, motility and viability had significant reduction in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Resveratrol increased count, motility and viable spermatozoa relative to the diabetic group (p < 0.05). The mean percentage of AB, AO and TB staining positive spermatozoa was increased in diabetic groups compared to control (p < 0.001) and decreased after treatment with 1 and 5 mg/kg resveratrol (p < 0.001). The results of AO and TB staining showed that resveratrol did not have any beneficial effect on chromatin condensation and denatured DNA at the dose of 10 mg/kg.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenol, has shown promising effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in animal models and is also reported to have cardioprotective properties, but human studies are limited. In a pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that resveratrol improves glucose metabolism and vascular function in older adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Ten subjects aged 72 ± 3 years (M ± SD) with IGT were enrolled in a 4-week open-label study of resveratrol (daily dose 1, 1.5, or 2 g). Following a standard mixed meal (110 g carbohydrate, 20 g protein, 20 g fat), we measured 3-hour glucose and insulin area under the curve (AUC), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), and secretion (corrected insulin response at 30 minutes). Endothelial function was assessed by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (reactive hyperemia index) before and 90 minutes postmeal. Results did not differ by dose, so data were combined for analysis. At baseline, body mass index was 29 ± 5 kg/m(2), fasting plasma glucose 110 ± 13 mg/dL, and 2-hour glucose 183 ± 33 mg/dL. After 4 weeks of resveratrol, fasting plasma glucose was unchanged, but peak postmeal (185 ± 10 vs 166 ± 9 mg/dL, p = .003) and 3-hour glucose AUC (469 ± 23 vs 428 ± 19, p = .001) declined. Matsuda index improved (3.1 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5, p = .03), and corrected insulin response at 30 minutes was unchanged (0.6 ± 0.1 vs 0.5 ± 0.5, p = .49). There was a trend toward improved postmeal reactive hyperemia index (baseline vs resveratrol postmeal delta -0.4 ± 0.2 vs 0.2 ± 0.3, p = .06). Weight, blood pressure, and lipids were unchanged. At doses between 1 and 2 g/day, resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity and postmeal plasma glucose in subjects with IGT. These preliminary findings support the conduct of larger studies to further investigate the effects of resveratrol on metabolism and vascular function.",

Therefore, we sought to investigate how RES affects skeletal muscle oxidative and antioxidant levels of subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondrial populations in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR) rats. Systemic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity together with expressions of several genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle SIRT1, SIRT3 protein levels were studied in rats fed a normal diet, a HFD, and a HFD with intervention of RES for 8 weeks. Oxidative stress levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed in SS and IMF mitochondria. HFD fed rats exhibited obvious systemic and skeletal muscle IR as well as decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05). Both SS and IMF mitochondria demonstrated elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. In addition, SS mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly lower, while IMF mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme activities were higher (p < 0.05). By contrast, RES treatment protected rats against diet induced IR, increased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions, mtDNA, and mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05). Moreover, the activities of SS and IMF mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes were increased, which reverted the increased SS mitochondrial oxidative stress levels (p < 0.05). This study suggests that RES ameliorates insulin sensitivity consistent with improved SIRT3 expressions and rebalance between SS mitochondrial oxidative stress and antioxidant competence in HFD rats.",

However, the absorption efficiency and in vivo bioactivity of Res are poor. High fat diet-induced metabolic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance, can promote AD-related β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, Tau protein phosphorylation and neurotoxicity. Gut microbiota play a role in modulating metabolic syndrome and cognitive impairment. Herein, flower-like Res-loaded selenium nanoparticles/chitosan nanoparticles (Res@SeNPs@Res-CS-NPs) with higher loading capacity (64 %) were prepared to regulate gut microbiota in cases of AD with metabolic disorder. The nano-flowers could restore gut microbiota homeostasis to reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) formation and LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Additionally, Res@SeNPs@Res-CS-NPs can prevent lipid deposition and insulin resistance by decreasing Firmicutes levels and increasing Bacteroidetes levels in the gut, further inhibiting Aβ aggregation and Tau protein phosphorylation through the JNK/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. Moreover, Res@SeNPs@Res-CS-NPs treatment was able to regulate the relative levels of gut microbiota associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and lipid deposition, including Entercoccus, Colidextribacter, Rikenella, Ruminococcus, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Alloprevotella and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006. Overall, Res@SeNPs@Res-CS-NPs significantly enhances cognitive ability in AD mice with metabolic disorder, highlighting their potential for preventing cognitive impairments in AD.",

It is a costly and laborious process, and it cannot monitor changes as a function of time. Recently, we have developed a new label-free live-cell FTIR approach that can directly measure biochemical compositional changes within living cells in situ and the spectral changes are shown to be highly specific to the drug applied. In this work, we have demonstrated for the first time the effect of two anti-diabetic drugs, metformin and Resveratrol, on insulin-resistant liver cells (HepG2). Using live-cell FTIR with principal component analysis, we have shown the differences in the biochemical profiles between normal and insulin-resistant cells (p < 0.05), the lack of response/difference from the insulin-resistant cell to insulin (p > 0.05) and the restoration of the biochemical profile and sensitivity to insulin from the insulin-resistant cells after the drug treatment (p < 0.05). Particularly, a rise in the glycogen level, marked by three distinctive peaks at 1150, 1080 and 1020 cm<sup>-1</sup>, within the living cells after the anti-diabetic drug treatments is observed. The live-cell FTIR results are confirmed by a parallel gold-standard biochemical assay, demonstrating the restoration of insulin sensitivity of the insulin-resistance cells. Live-cell FTIR can be a complementary tool for drug efficacy screening, especially for insulin sensitizers.",

High-protein diet tended to increase insulin resistance and atheromatous risk. Resveratrol improved insulin sensitivity in old mice fed standard diet by decreasing homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance and resistin levels. However, resveratrol did not improve insulin resistance status in old mice receiving the high-protein diet. In contrast, resveratrol exhibited deleterious effects by increasing inflammation state and superoxide production and diminishing aortic distensibility.

      "abstract": "Hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for periodontitis and it polarizes the immune cells towards an inflammatory state. Specific biomaterials can deliver therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents to regulate the excessive periodontal inflammation. Dendritic cells (DCs) bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and are crucially involved in periodontitis. Thus, targeting DCs is an attractive treatment option for diabetic periodontitis, which, by modulating the downstream adaptive immune cells could regulate the host immune responses. In this study, a chitosan-based thermosensitive injectable self-assembled hydrogel (TISH) was developed to modulate DCs towards a tolerogenic phenotype, which can induce regulatory T-cells to attenuate inflammation and promote healing. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and resveratrol were loaded into TISH (TISH(G + R)) and were sustainably released. TISH demonstrated good biocompatibility and cell penetration in its porous structure. DCs grown in TISH(G + R) under an <i>in vitro</i> hyperglycemic condition showed reduced maturation and activation markers such as <i>CD80</i>, <i>CD83</i> and <i>CD86</i>, while simultaneously upregulated tolerogenic genes such as <i>FOXP3, SOCS3</i>, <i>TGFß</i> and <i>IL10</i>. Co-culture of these tolerogenic DCs with naïve T-cells induced regulatory T-cells differentiation, evidenced by elevated gene expressions of <i>FOXP3</i>, <i>TGFβ</i> and <i>IL-10</i>. <i>In vivo</i> subcutaneous injection of TISH (G + R) into the mice showed significant infiltration of DCs and regulatory T-cells. In conclusion, TISH was developed and optimized as an injectable hydrogel to modulate DCs towards the tolerogenic phenotype and induce regulatory T-cells under hyperglycemia. TISH has promising potential to improve periodontal parameters in diabetic periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol compound contained in numerous plants, has been proposed as a treatment for obesity-related disease processes such as insulin resistance. However, in humans there are conflicting results concerning the efficacy of resveratrol in improving insulin action; the purpose of the present study was to determine whether obesity status (lean, severely obese) affects the response to resveratrol in human skeletal muscle. Primary skeletal muscle cells were derived from biopsies obtained from age-matched lean and insulin-resistant women with severe obesity and incubated with resveratrol (1 µM) for 24 h. Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and incorporation into glycogen, insulin signal transduction, and energy-sensitive protein targets [AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Sirt1, and PGC1α] were analyzed. Insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and AMPK phosphorylation increased with resveratrol incubation compared with the nonresveratrol conditions (main treatment effect for resveratrol). Resveratrol further increased IRS1, Akt, and TBC1D4 insulin-stimulated phosphorylation and SIRT1 content in myotubes from lean women, but not in women with severe obesity. Resveratrol improves insulin action in primary human skeletal myotubes derived from lean women and women with severe obesity. In women with obesity, these improvements may be associated with enhanced AMPK phosphorylation with resveratrol treatment.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> A physiologically relevant dose of resveratrol increases insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis in myotubes from individuals with severe obesity. Furthermore, resveratrol improved insulin signal transduction in myotubes from lean individuals but not from individuals with obesity. Activation of AMPK plays a role in resveratrol-induced improvements in glucose metabolism in individuals with severe obesity.",

This study examined the inhibitory effects of resveratrol and stilbenoid tetramers, vaticanol B, (-)-hopeaphenol, and vatalbinoside A on human salivary and pancreatic α-amylases experimentally and through molecular docking studies. Vaticanol B demonstrated the most potent inhibition with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 5.3 ± 0.3 μM for salivary and 6.1 ± 0.5 μM for pancreatic α-amylase (compared to acarbose with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.2 ± 0.1 μM and 0.5 ± 0.0 μM, respectively). Kinetic analysis suggested a competitive inhibition mode for vaticanol B. Resveratrol and vatalbinoside A were poor inhibitors of human α-amylases, while (-)-hopeaphenol exhibited moderate inhibition. Molecular docking supported the inhibition data, and several aspects of the structural configurations explained the stronger inhibition exerted by vaticanol B. Overall, vaticanol B shows promise as a natural alternative to acarbose for inhibiting α-amylase.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the signaling mechanisms underlying the protecting effects of RSV against endothelial dysfunction during hyperglycemia in vitro and in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with RSV, and then exposed to high glucose (HG, 30 mmol/L). Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation, eNOS-Ser1177 phosphorylation, and PTEN protein levels in the cells were detected using Western blot. For in vivo studies, WT and Akt<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed a normal diet containing RSV (400 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>) for 2 weeks, then followed by injection of STZ to induce hyperglycemia (300 mg/dL). Endothelial function was evaluated using aortic rings by assessing ACh-induced vasorelaxation. RSV (5-20 μmol/L) dose-dependently increased Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation, accompanied by increased eNOS-Ser1177 phosphorylation in HUVECs; these effects were more prominent under HG stimulation. Transfection with Akt siRNA abolished RSV-enhanced eNOS phosphorylation and NO release. Furthermore, RSV (5-20 μmol/L) dose-dependently decreased the levels of PTEN, which was significantly increased under HG stimulation, and PTEN overexpression abolished RSV-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HG-treated HUVECs. Moreover, RSV dramatically increased 26S proteasome activity, which induced degradation of PTEN. In in vivo studies, pretreatment with RSV significantly increased Akt and eNOS phosphorylation in aortic tissues and ACh-induced vasorelaxation, and improved diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction in wild-type mice but not in Akt<sup>-/-</sup> mice. RSV attenuates endothelial function during hyperglycemia via activating proteasome-dependent degradation of PTEN, which increases Akt phosphorylation, and consequentially upregulation of eNOS-derived NO production.",

However, whether SIRT1 also plays a protective role in vascular dysfunction of diabetic and obese mice is not fully characterized. Previous work showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) is beneficial in diabetic vascular dysfunction. Whether PPARδ is involved in the beneficial effect of SIRT1 on vascular endothelial function is unknown. We used mice with overexpression of endothelial cell-specific human SIRT1 (SIRT1-Tg) and dominant-negative SIRT1 (SIRT1-mut) fed with normal chow and high fat diet to show that expression of functional SIRT1 in endothelium protects against vascular dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice. Endothelial-specific overexpression of SIRT1 improved endothelium-dependent dilation in aortas treated with risk factors including high glucose, angiotensin II, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Oral treatment with resveratrol treatment improves endothelial function in high fat diet fed wild type Ppard-wt but not in PPARδ knockout Ppard-mut mice. Experiments on isolated arteries also showed that the effect of resveratrol or SIRT1 activator CAY10602 was inhibited by PPARδ antagonist GSK0660. Resveratrol increased PPARδ transcriptional activity in endothelial cells. Results demonstrated here indicated that PPARδ contributes to the beneficial effect of SIRT1 to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and obese mice. These results help to understand SIRT1-based strategy for treating vascular and metabolic dysfunction in the context of obesity and insulin resistance.",

Here, we study the effects of a mixture of RSV + QRC on oxidative stress (OS) and fatty liver in a rat model of MS. Weanling male Wistar rats were separated into four groups (<i>n</i> = 8): MS rats with 30% sucrose in drinking water plus RSV + QRC (50 and 0.95 mg/kg/day, respectively), MS rats without treatment, control rats (C), and C rats plus RSV + QRC. MS rats had increased systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, insulin levels, insulin resistance index homeostasis model (HOMA), adiponectin, and leptin. The RSV + QRC mixture compensated these variables to C values (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in MS rats. Lipid peroxidation and carbonylation were increased in MS. Total antioxidant capacity and glutathione (GSH) were decreased in MS and compensated in MS plus RVS + QRC rats. Catalase, superoxide dismutase isoforms, peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and the expression of Nrf2 were decreased in MS and reversed in MS plus RVS + QRC rats (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, the mixture of RSV + QRC has benefic effects on OS in fatty liver in the MS rats through the improvement of the antioxidant capacity and by the over-expression of the master factor Nrf2, which increases the antioxidant enzymes and GSH recycling.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of polyphenols of different chemical structure on miR-33a and miR-122 expression and to determine whether direct binding of the polyphenol to the mature microRNAs (miRNAs) is a plausible mechanism of modulation. The effect of two grape proanthocyanidin extracts, their fractions and pure polyphenol compounds on miRNA expression was evaluated using hepatic cell lines. Results demonstrated that the effect on miRNA expression depended on the polyphenol chemical structure. Moreover, miR-33a was repressed independently of its host-gene SREBP2. Therefore, the ability of resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate to bind miR-33a and miR-122 was measured using (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Both compounds bound miR-33a and miR-122 and differently. Interestingly, the nature of the binding of these compounds to the miRNAs was consistent with their effects on cell miRNA levels. Therefore, the specific and direct binding of polyphenols to miRNAs emerges as a new posttranscriptional mechanism by which polyphenols could modulate metabolism.",

This study aimed to determine if TSG therapy could alleviate bone deteriorations in diabetic mouse model induced by streptozotocin. The diabetic mice showed the loss of trabecular bone mass and the changes of trabecular bone microarchitectural parameters as well as the increase in amount of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts at the distal metaphysis of femur when compared with those of nondiabetic mice. Treatment with TSG significantly elevated calcium content in serum and bone and improved biological parameters of trabecular bone, accompanied by increasing messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of RUNX-2, COL-I, and OCN and protein expression of β-catenin as well as down-regulating protein expression of RAS components including renin and AT1R. In addition, TSG repressed diabetes-induced decrease in ratio of OPG/RANKL expression and increase in sclerostin expression in bone. The similar effects of TSG on osteoblasts-specific genes were found in MC3T3-E1 cells. Taken together, the present study demonstrated the osteopreserve effects of TSG in diabetic mice, and the underlying mechanism might be attributed to its regulation on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin, has been suggested to have beneficial effects in age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Studies indicate that it may delay memory decline and exert neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, and the impact of resveratrol on central insulin resistance-a key feature of neurodegenerative disorders-remains insufficiently explored. Given the potential therapeutic significance of targeting insulin sensitivity in neurodegeneration, further investigation into the role of resveratrol in modulating these pathways is warranted. Our aim was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on insulin signaling and mitochondrial function in a previously established streptozotocin-induced in vitro neurodegeneration model. The phosphorylation status of key insulin signaling proteins and regulators of insulin resistance and autophagy markers were analyzed via Western blot and an ELISA-based microarray technique. The effects of resveratrol on mitochondrial biogenesis were evaluated through Mitotracker staining and quantification of mitochondrial mRNA and protein expression. Resveratrol augmented the cytoprotective effect of insulin in a concentration-dependent manner. It reduced the Ser(312) phosphorylation of IRS1, which is commonly linked to insulin resistance, and lowered the IC<sub>50</sub> value for Tyr(895) phosphorylation required for activation. Similar insulin-sensitizing effects were observed in downstream signaling components. Resveratrol treatment exerted a caloric restriction mimetic activity through activating the AMPK/PGC1α/SIRT1 pathway and upregulated the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM and ATP synthase subunit (ATP5B). Despite the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis, the number of mitochondria was not altered, because it simultaneously induced autophagy marked by ULK1 phoshorylation and LC3 lipidation. Our findings indicate that resveratrol can enhance insulin signaling, even at the initial step of IRS1 phosphorylation. Its insulin-sensitizing effects extend beyond metabolic regulation to include survival responses. Resveratrol as a caloric restriction mimetic exerted a balanced effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy therefore improving mitochondrial quality control.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic foot wounds (DFUs) are counted as one of the most common microvascular complications associated with poorly controlled and chronic diabetes mellitus. It confers a serious challenge to clinical practice, surmounting hyperglycemia-induced disturbance in angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction, with limited fruitful intervention to control the manifestations of DFUs. Resveratrol (RV) can improve endothelial function and has strong pro-angiogenic properties for the treatment of diabetic foot wounds. The present study aims to design an RV-loaded liposome-in-hydrogel system to effectively heal diabetic foot ulcers. A thin-film hydration method was used to prepare RV-loaded liposomes. Liposomal vesicles were assessed, for various characteristics such as particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency. The best-prepared liposomal vesicle was then incorporated into 1% carbopol 940 gel to develop a hydrogel system. The RV-loaded liposomal gel showed improved skin penetration. To assess the efficacy of the developed formulation, a diabetic foot ulcer animal model was used. The topical application of the developed formulation significantly reduced blood glucose and increased glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to improve ulcer healing as well as wound closure on day 9. Faster re-epithelization, proliferation of fibroblast, formation of collagen, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration at the wound site were also noted. Results indicate that RV-loaded liposomes in hydrogel-based wound dressing significantly accelerate wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers by restoring the altered wound healing process in diabetics.",

      "abstract": "High levels of fructose in the diet results in metabolic abnormalities and vascular disorders. In this study, the effect of resveratrol (RES) on vascular relaxation and contraction responses was examined in the aorta of high-fructose (HFr)-fed rats. mRNA expressions of aortic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), GLUT5, and aldolase B were also investigated. Rats were given fructose (30%) and (or) RES (50 mg · L(-1)) in their drinking water for 8 weeks. In the HFr-fed rats, plasma levels of arginine and the ratio of arginine:asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) decreased, whereas leptin levels increased. Decreased relaxation and increased contractile responses were detected in aortic rings. However, the aortic expressions of SIRT1, GLUT5, and aldolase B remained unchanged. RES treatment restored HFr-induced vascular dysfunction without improvements in insulin resistance. Treatment of HFr-fed rats with RES increased plasma levels of arginine and the L-arginine:ADMA ratio, and decreased plasma levels of leptin. RES increased SIRT1 expression, but decreased the expression of GLUT5 and aldolase B in aortas from HFr-fed rats. These results suggest that RES contributes to the restoration of HFr-induced vascular dysfunction in rats, at least in part, by up-regulation of SIRT 1 and down-regulation of GLUT5 and aldolase B in the aorta. Moreover, RES may have a positive influence on vasculature by partly restoring the plasma arginine:ADMA ratio and leptin levels.",

Evidence shows that high glucose generates oxidative stress and a pro-inflammatory state promoting the development of cardiovascular diseases. trans-Resveratrol (t-RV) has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. To determine whether t-RV acts as a protector against acute high glucose (AHG)-induced damage, two in vitro models, rat aortic rings (RAR) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used. RAR pretreated with AHG (25 mM D-glucose) for 3 h dramatically decreased the endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) induced by acetylcholine in phenylephrine (PE)-precontracted vessels. However, coincubation with t-RV significantly mitigated the damage induced by AHG on EDR. Pretreatment with AHG did not affect the vasodilation induced by sodium nitroprusside. HUVEC treated with t-RV decreased cytotoxicity and reduced radical oxygen species production induced by AHG. Taken together, these results suggest that t-RV can mitigate the AHG-induced EDR damage through a mechanism involving ROS scavenging and probably an increase in the bioavailability of NO.",

Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) could regulate glucose metabolism through its deacetylase activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of SIRT1/forkhead box protein 1 (FoxO1) pathway on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced INS-1 cells dysfunction from aspects of oxidative stress and apoptosis. After being treated with 1 mg/L LPS together with or without SIRT1 activator resveratrol (RSV) or SIRT1 inhibitor EX527, cell viability, ROS generation, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide, insulin secretion, and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in INS-1 cells were measured by specific assays. Protein expression of SIRT1, FoxO1, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and acetylated FoxO1 (ac-FoxO1) were detected by western blot analysis. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was extracted respectively to analyze SIRT1 and FoxO1 redistribution. Mitochondrial potentials and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry or observed under fluorescence microscope. Results showed that LPS decreased cell viability and insulin secretion, increased ROS, MDA, and superoxide generation, whereas inhibited SOD activity and FoxO1 nuclear transportation. Activation of SIRT1 by RSV down-regulated TLR4 expression, SIRT1 and FoxO1 nuclear protein expression increased after RSV pretreatment. Additionally, LPS induced decreased mitochondrial membrane potentials and structural abnormalities, which could be partially reversed by RSV. SIRT1/FoxO1 may be one of potential targets which could resist against LPS-induced INS-1 cells from oxidative stress damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol, non‑flavonoid plant‑derived antitoxin, ameliorates hyperuricemia and kidney inflammation. The present study aimed to establish a model of high‑fat diet (HFD)‑induced insulin resistance (IR) and to determine the specific mechanism of RSV to improve kidney inflammation and reduce uric acid (UA). C57BL/6J mice were fed a HFD for 12 weeks and their glucose tolerance was evaluated by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing. The mice were then administered RSV for 6 weeks, and blood and kidney samples were collected. Serum UA and insulin concentrations were determined using ELISA kits. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid‑Schiff and Masson staining were performed to observe the pathological changes of the kidney, and electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the kidney ultrastructure. The renal concentrations of interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑18, IL‑1β and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) were measured using ELISA kits, and western blotting evaluated changes in the protein expression levels of various indicators. RSV significantly ameliorated HFD‑induced IR and reduced blood UA levels. Long‑term IR can lead to lipid deposition, glycogen accumulation, inflammatory damage and fibrotic changes in the kidney of mice. This leads to a significant increase in the expression of UA transport‑related proteins, an increase in UA reabsorption and an increase in blood UA levels. Notably, RSV intervention was able to reverse this process. The effect of RSV may be achieved by inhibiting the NOD‑like receptor family, pyrin domain‑containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear factor‑κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, RSV may improve kidney inflammation through TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling pathways, and reduce the expression of UA transporter proteins in the kidney of insulin‑resistant mice, thereby reducing blood UA levels.",

In this study, HEK-293 cells and kidney tissue of male Wistar rats were used in hyperglycemia condition. Quercetin and Resveratrol for cell culture and in vivo evaluation were used. Amount of methylglyoxal and the gene and protein expression of the Senescence Marker Protein30 (SMP30) were measured using qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. High glucose condition in kidney cell and tissue caused increase in glyoxal amount compared to control sample. Treatment with Resveratrol and/or Quercetin significantly decreased the amount of methylglyoxal in a dose-dependent manner. SMP30 expression significantly decreased compare to control group while treatment with Resveratrol and/or Quercetin considerably increased expression level of the protein. Six weeks treatment with Quercetin and Resveratrol had more beneficial effects on aging markers compared with three weeks.

Given this connection, two drugs, metformin (MET) and resveratrol (RESV), are considered for the clearance of amyloid-β peptides through AMPK-mediated activation of autophagy. However, overactivation of AMPK observed in late-stage AD brains and relationships between AMPK and neurogenesis (through mTORC1 inhibition), questions treatment with these drugs. To examine if MET and/or RESV supplementation activates brain AMPK, regulates markers of autophagy, and affects markers of neuronal health/neurogenesis. 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low (N = 12; 10% kcal fat; LFD) or high fat diet (N = 40; 60% kcal fat; HFD) for 9 weeks to induce insulin resistance and obesity. HFD mice were then treated with/without MET (250 mg/kg/day), RESV (100 mg/kg/day), or COMBO (MET: 250 mg/kg/day, RESV: 100 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were extracted for western blotting analysis. Cortex AMPK (T172) and raptor (S792, the regulatory subunit of mTORC1) phosphorylation were upregulated following RESV, COMBO treatments. mTOR (S2448) and ULK1 (S555) activation was seen following MET, COMBO and RESV, COMBO treatments, respectively, in the cortex and hippocampus. p62 content was decreased following RESV, COMBO, with LC3 content being increased following RESV treatment in the cortex. Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) was significantly decreased following RESV, COMBO, and synaptophysin following all treatment in the cortex.

      "abstract": "The dietary supplement, <i>trans</i>-resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP), induces expression of glyoxalase 1, countering the accumulation of reactive dicarbonyl glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), in overweight and obese subjects. tRES-HESP produced reversal of insulin resistance, improving dysglycemia and low-grade inflammation in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Herein, we report further analysis of study variables. MG metabolism-related variables correlated with BMI, dysglycemia, vascular inflammation, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. With tRES-HESP treatment, plasma MG correlated negatively with endothelial independent arterial dilatation (r = -0.48, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and negatively with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) quinone reductase activity (r = -0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.05)-a marker of the activation status of transcription factor Nrf2. For change from baseline of PBMC gene expression with tRES-HESP treatment, Glo1 expression correlated negatively with change in the oral glucose tolerance test area-under-the-curve plasma glucose (ΔAUGg) (r = -0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) correlated positively with ΔAUGg (r = 0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) correlated positively with change in fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.70, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and negatively with change in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.01). These correlations were not present with placebo. tRES-HESP decreased low-grade inflammation, characterized by decreased expression of CCL2, COX-2, IL-8, and RAGE. Changes in CCL2, IL-8, and RAGE were intercorrelated and all correlated positively with changes in MLXIP, MAFF, MAFG, NCF1, and FTH1, and negatively with changes in HMOX1 and TKT; changes in IL-8 also correlated positively with change in COX-2. Total urinary excretion of tRES and HESP metabolites were strongly correlated. These findings suggest tRES-HESP counters MG accumulation and protein glycation, decreasing activation of the unfolded protein response and expression of TXNIP and TNFα, producing reversal of insulin resistance. tRES-HESP is suitable for further evaluation for treatment of insulin resistance and related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of inflammation and has anti-diabetic potentiality, however whether its anti-inflammatory potency contributes to the amelioration of diabetes or insulin resistance remains to be determined. This study aims at evaluating the effects of resveratrol on inflammation-related adipokines expression and insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. We stimulated RAW264.7 cells with LPS and collected the supernatant as a conditioned medium (CM) for the culture of adipocytes. Resveratrol, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 muM, effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production with the downregulation of relative genes expression in macrophages. Exposing differentiated 3T3-L1 cells to RAW264.7 CM resulted in gene over-expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and resistin, however, mRNA expression of adiponectin and PPARgamma were down-regulated. Pretreatment of CM from resveratrol-treated macrophages reduced the elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and significantly reversed inflammation-related changes in adipokine gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Resveratrol suppressed extracellular receptor-activated kinase (ERK) and transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation by reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB p65; moreover, it modulated insulin signaling transduction by modification of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and downstream AKT (T308), and thereby improved insulin sensitivity in adiposities. These results demonstrated that resveratrol modulated adipokines expression and improved insulin sensitivity which relative to inhibition of inflammatory-like response in adipocytes.",

We hypothesized that when administered to pregnant nonhuman primates (NHPs), resveratrol would increase uterine blood flow and mitigate the harmful consequences of maternal Western-style diet (WSD) consumption. NHPs were fed a WSD (36% fat) supplemented with 0.37% resveratrol throughout pregnancy. Outcomes were compared with cohorts fed WSD alone and control chow (14% fat) to distinguish between WSD and resveratrol-specific effects in these animals. In the early third trimester, uterine blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound before fetal delivery and tissue collection. Resveratrol resulted in 30% maternal weight loss and improved glucose tolerance, increased uterine artery volume blood flow, and decreased placental inflammation and liver triglyceride deposition. In addition, fetal pancreatic mass was enlarged by 42%, with a 12-fold increase in proliferation by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. These results demonstrate that resveratrol use during pregnancy yields improvements in maternal and placental phenotype with beneficial effects in the fetal liver but an unexplained and concerning alteration in fetal pancreatic development, which strongly cautions against the use of resveratrol by pregnant women.",

However, the effects of fermented Pc on skeletal muscle strength remain unexplored. In this study, we generated fermented Pc using a complex of microorganisms containing <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. (McPc) and assessed its effects on muscle strength and motor function in mice. Compared to unfermented Pc water extract, elevated levels of emodin and resveratrol were noted in McPc. This was identified and quantified using UPLC-QTOF/MS and HPLC techniques. Gene expression profiling through RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that McPc administration upregulated the expression of genes associated with antioxidants, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured C2C12 myotubes and the gastrocnemius muscle in mice. McPc significantly improved skeletal muscle strength, motor coordination, and traction force in mice subjected to sciatic neurectomy and high-fat diet (HFD). McPc administration exhibited more pronounced improvement of obesity, hyperglycemia, fatty liver, and hyperlipidemia in HFD mice compared to control group. These findings support the notion that emodin and resveratrol-enriched McPc may offer health benefits for addressing skeletal muscle weakness.",

This action is, however, not fully elucidated. In the present study, we examined effects of resveratrol on some parameters related to insulin signaling, and also on diabetes-associated dysregulation in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats with congenital type 2 diabetes. Resveratrol was given at the dose of 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 weeks. It was shown that the expression and phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor in the skeletal muscle of GK rats were significantly decreased, compared with control animals. However, these changes were totally prevented by resveratrol. Liver expression of the insulin receptor was also reduced, but in this case, resveratrol was ineffective. Resveratrol was also demonstrated to significantly influence parameters of insulin binding (dissociation constant and binding capacity) in the skeletal muscle and liver. Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of proteins related to intracellular glucose transport (GLUT4 and TUG) in adipose tissue of GK rats were significantly decreased. However, treatment with resveratrol completely abolished these changes. Resveratrol was found to induce normalization of TUG expression in the skeletal muscle. Blood levels of insulin and GIP were elevated, whereas proinsulin and GLP-1 diminished in GK rats. However, concentrations of these hormones were not affected by resveratrol. These results indicate that resveratrol partially ameliorates diabetes-associated dysregulation in GK rats. The most relevant finding covers the normalization of the insulin receptor expression in the skeletal muscle and also GLUT4 and TUG in adipose tissue.",

We tested the hypothesis that an AMP-activated protein kinase activator, resveratrol (RES), which is known to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, would attenuate peripheral and central inflammation and improve memory deficit in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD or an HFD supplemented with RES for 20 weeks. Metabolic parameters in serum were evaluated, and Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in peripheral organs and brain were completed. We used the Morris water maze test to study the role of RES on memory function in HFD-treated mice. RES treatment reduced hepatic steatosis, macrophage infiltration, and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. In the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice, the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and Iba-1 expression were reduced by RES treatment. Choline acetyltransferase was increased, and the phosphorylation of tau was decreased in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice upon RES treatment. In particular, we found that RES significantly improved memory deficit in HFD-fed mice. These findings indicate that RES reverses obesity-related peripheral and central inflammation and metabolic derangements and improves memory deficit in HFD-fed diabetic mice.",

In this study, we investigated a novel therapeutic strategy using chitosan-stabilized Res/SeNPs (CS/Res/SeNPs) in a mouse model of T2DM induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injections. We evaluated the effects of these nanoparticles on glucose and insulin levels, oxidative/antioxidant balance, expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, and inflammatory mediators using biochemical, histopathological, and molecular docking analyses. Treatment with free Res, CS/Res/SeNPs-5, CS/Res/SeNPs-10, and Metformin (Met) improved hyperglycemia, insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia, and normalized elevated liver and kidney biomarkers. These treatments also exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. CS/Res/SeNPs-10 showed the most potent hepatoprotective and anti-diabetic effects. The docking results revealed that Res binds to key insulin signaling proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Collectively, our findings highlight the therapeutic promise of CS/Res/SeNPs in managing T2DM complications and suggest a cost-effective strategy to enhance health outcomes and quality of life in diabetic patients.",

Resveratrol has been proposed as a potential anti-metabolic disorder compound, by its activation of sirtuin and AMP-activated protein kinase. Many reports show that resveratrol ameliorates diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, it is not known whether piceatannol also affects diet-induced obesity. We explored the effect of piceatannol on high fat diet-fed mice. The results showed that piceatannol did not affect high fat diet-induced body weight gain or visceral fat gain in mice. However, piceatannol did reduce fasting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, to explore the potential of passion fruit seed extract containing piceatannol as a functional food, passion fruit seed extract was administered in a genetic diabetic mouse model (db/db mice). Single administration of passion fruit seed extract, as well as piceatannol reduced the blood glucose levels of these db/db mice. These results suggest that piceatannol and passion fruit seed extract may have potential application in the prevention of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES) and curcumin (CUR) are polyphenols that are found in fruits and turmeric, and possess medicinal properties that are beneficial in various diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Results from recent studies have indicated that their therapeutic properties can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory effects. Owing to reports stating that they protect against β-cell dysfunction, we studied their mechanism(s) of action in β-cells. In T2DM, cAMP plays a critical role in glucose- and incretin-stimulated insulin secretion as well as overall pancreatic β-cell health. A potential therapeutic target in the management of T2DM lies in regulating the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which degrade cAMP. Both RES and CUR have been reported to act as PDE inhibitors in various cell types, but it remains unknown if they do so in pancreatic β-cells. In our current study, we found that both RES (0.1-10 μmol/l) and CUR (1-100 pmol/l)-regulated insulin secretion under glucose-stimulated conditions. Additionally, treating β-cell lines and human islets with these polyphenols led to increased intracellular cAMP levels in a manner similar to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a classic PDE inhibitor. When we investigated the effects of RES and CUR on PDEs, we found that treatment significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of most of the 11 PDE isozymes, including PDE3B, PDE8A, and PDE10A, which have been linked previously to regulation of insulin secretion in islets. Furthermore, RES and CUR inhibited PDE activity in a dose-dependent manner in β-cell lines and human islets. Collectively, we demonstrate a novel role for natural-occurring polyphenols as PDE inhibitors that enhance pancreatic β-cell function.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the aetiology of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, although there is considerable controversy regarding these concepts. Mitochondrial function has been traditionally assessed in the presence of saturating ADP, but ATP turnover and the resultant ADP is thought to limit respiration in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the potential link between submaximal ADP-stimulated respiration rates, ROS generation and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the ZDF rat. Utilizing permeabilized muscle fibres we observed that submaximal ADP-stimulated respiration rates (250-2000 μm ADP) were lower in ZDF rats than in lean controls, which coincided with decreased adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) protein content. This decrease in submaximal ADP-stimulated respiration occurred in the absence of a decrease in electron transport chain function. Treating ZDF rats with resveratrol improved skeletal muscle insulin resistance and this was associated with elevated submaximal ADP-stimulated respiration rates as well as an increase in ANT2 protein content. These results coincided with a greater ability of ADP to attenuate mitochondrial ROS emission and an improvement in cellular redox balance. Together, these data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is present in skeletal muscle insulin resistance when assessed at submaximal ADP concentrations and that ADP dynamics may influence skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity through alterations in the propensity for mitochondrial ROS emission.",

      "abstract": "Diet-induced obesity is associated with metabolic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Polyphenols such as resveratrol and the synthetic flavonoid derivative S17834 exert beneficial systemic and cardiovascular effects in a variety of settings including diabetes mellitus and chronic hemodynamic overload. We characterized the structural and functional features of a mouse model of diet-induced metabolic syndrome and used the model to test the hypothesis that the polyphenols prevent myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet or a diet high in fat and sugar (HFHS) with or without concomitant treatment with S17834 or resveratrol for up to 8 months. HFHS diet-fed mice developed progressive left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction with preservation of systolic function in association with myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. In HFHS diet-fed mice, there was increased myocardial oxidative stress with evidence of oxidant-mediated protein modification via tyrosine nitration and 4-OH-2-nonenol adduction. HFHS diet-fed mice also exhibited increases in plasma fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance indicative of insulin resistance. Treatment with S17834 or resveratrol prevented left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. For S17834, these beneficial effects were associated with decreases in oxidant-mediated protein modifications and hyperinsulinemia and increased plasma adiponectin. Resveratrol and S17834 administered concurrently with a HFHS diet prevent the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial effects of the polyphenols, including a reduction in myocardial oxidative stress and related protein modifications, amelioration of insulin resistance, and increased plasma adiponectin. The polyphenols resveratrol and S17834 may be of value in the prevention of diet-induced metabolic heart disease.",

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition by resveratrol improves peripheral insulin sensitivity of these mice. Although resveratrol activates Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are not totally elucidated. In this study, we have investigated whether Sirt1 mediates the effects of resveratrol in controlling insulin resistance in diabetic mice. We attempted to ameliorate peripheral insulin resistance in two diabetic models, Irs2-deficient (Irs2(-/-)) mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice by resveratrol treatment or Sirt1 overexpression. Resveratrol improved systemic insulin sensitivity of Irs2-deficient mice. Irs2-deficient mice are characterized by high levels of PTP1B expression in liver and muscle. Interestingly, resveratrol decreased PTP1B in both tissues, thereby restoring IRS1-mediated insulin signaling. Moreover, resveratrol also restored insulin sensitivity and hepatic insulin signaling in STZ-diabetic mice. In contrast, moderate overexpression of Sirt1 neither normalized PTP1B levels nor restored insulin signaling in Irs2-deficient mice or STZ-diabetic mice. Resveratrol improves peripheral insulin signaling independently of Sirt1 in diabetic mice in association with the inhibition of PTP1B and, therefore, this polyphenol could be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of diabetes.",

C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed a normal diet with RV (0.005% and 0.02%, w/w) or rosiglitazone (RG, 0.001%, w/w) for 6 weeks. Both doses of RV significantly decreased blood glucose, plasma free fatty acid, triglyceride, apo B/apo AІ levels and increased plasma adiponectin levels. RV activated AMPK and downstream targets leading to decreased blood HbA1c levels, hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme activity, and hepatic glycogen, while plasma insulin levels, pancreatic insulin protein, and skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein were higher after RV supplementation. The high RV dose also significantly increased hepatic glycolytic gene expression and enzyme activity, along with skeletal muscle glycogen synthase protein expression, similar to RG. Furthermore, RV dose dependently decreased hepatic triglyceride content and phosphorylated I kappa B kinase (p-IKK) protein expression, while hepatic uncoupling protein (UCP) and skeletal muscle UCP expression were increased. RV potentiates improving glycemic control, glucose uptake, and dyslipidemia, as well as protecting against pancreatic β-cell failure in a spontaneous type 2 diabetes model. Dietary RV has potential as an antidiabetic agent via activation of AMPK and its downstream targets.",

The aims of this study was to study the impact of resveratrol supplementation in adjunct with non-surgical periodontal therapy on inflammatory, antioxidant, and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes with periodontal disease. In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into two intervention and control groups receiving either resveratrol supplements or placebo for 4 weeks. Serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) as the main index of periodontal marker were measured pre-intervention and post-intervention. In the intervention group, the mean serum level of IL6 was reduced significantly (P = 0.039) post-intervention (2.19 ± 1.09 and 1.58 ± 1.06). No significant differences were seen in the mean levels of IL6, TNFα, TAC and CAL between two groups post-intervention. It is suggested that daily consumption of resveratrol supplement may not change TNFα, TAC and CAL, but it would be beneficial in reducing serum levels of IL6. Therefore, further studies are suggested to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation along with NST on periodontal status.",

      "abstract": "In non-athletes, insulin sensitivity correlates negatively with intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content. In athletes, however, a pattern of benign IMCL storage exists, which is characterized by lipid storage in type I muscle fibres, in small and numerous lipid droplets (LDs) preferable coated with PLIN5, without affecting insulin sensitivity. Administration of resveratrol has been promoted for its beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. We observed that 30 days of oral resveratrol administration (150 mg/day) in metabolically compromised individuals showed a 33% increase in IMCL (placebo vs. resveratrol; 0.86 ± 0.090 AU vs. 1.14 ± 0.11 AU, p = 0.003) without impeding insulin sensitivity. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine if a resveratrol-mediated increase in IMCL content, in metabolically compromised individuals, changes the LD phenotype towards the phenotype we previously observed in athletes. For this, we studied IMCL, LD number, LD size, subcellular distribution and PLIN5 coating in different fibre types using high-resolution confocal microscopy. As proof of concept, we observed a 2.3-fold increase (p = 0.038) in lipid accumulation after 48 h of resveratrol incubation in cultured human primary muscle cells. In vivo analysis showed that resveratrol-induced increase in IMCL is predominantly in type I muscle fibres (placebo vs. resveratrol; 0.97 ± 0.16% vs. 1.26 ± 0.09%; p = 0.030) in both the subsarcolemmal (p = 0.016) and intermyofibrillar region (p = 0.026) and particularly in PLIN5-coated LDs (p = 0.024). These data indicate that administration of resveratrol augments IMCL content in metabolically compromised individuals towards a LD phenotype that mimics an 'athlete like phenotype'.",

      "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 damages retinal mitochondria, activating the apoptotic machinery. Transcription of MMP-9 is regulated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and the activation of NF-κB is modulated by the acetylation of its p65 subunit. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a deacetylase, plays an important role in the acetylation-deacetylation of p65. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of Sirt1 in the activation of MMP-9 in diabetic retinopathy. The effect of hyperglycemia and Sirt1 activator, resveratrol, on acetylation of p65 and its binding at MMP-9 promoter-and mitochondrial damage and apoptosis-was assessed in the retinal endothelial cells. Role of oxidative stress in the regulation of Sirt1 was evaluated in the cells incubated in H2O2. The results were confirmed in the retina from diabetic mice with Sod2 or MMP-9 gene manipulated. High glucose decreased Sirt1 activity and increased p65 acetylation, and resveratrol prevented increase in p65 acetylation, binding of p65 at MMP-9 promoter and MMP-9 activation, mitochondria damage, and cell apoptosis. While Sirt1 was decreased by H2O2, MMP-9 was significantly increased. Retina from wild-type diabetic mice presented similar decrease in Sirt1, and diabetic mice with Sod2 overexpression or MMP-9 deletion had normal retinal Sirt1. Retinal microvasculature from human donors with established diabetic retinopathy also had decreased Sirt1. Thus, in diabetes, increase in oxidative stress inhibits Sirt1 and p65 is hyperacetylated, increasing the binding of p65 at MMP-9 promoter. Prevention of Sirt1 inhibition, via modulating acetylation of p65, should protect activation of MMP-9 and inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy.",

There are currently no effective pharmacological therapies for NAFLD, although lifestyle and dietary modifications targeting weight reduction are among the prevailing alternative approaches. For this reason, new approaches should be investigated. The natural polyphenol resveratrol represents a potential new treatment for management of NAFLD due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Although preclinical trials have demonstrated promising results of resveratrol against NALFD, the lack of conclusive results creates the need for more trials with larger numbers of patients, longer time courses, and standardized protocols.",

      "abstract": "Calorie restriction extends lifespan and produces a metabolic profile desirable for treating diseases of ageing such as type 2 diabetes. SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, is a principal modulator of pathways downstream of calorie restriction that produce beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic SIRT1 activator, mimics the anti-ageing effects of calorie restriction in lower organisms and in mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorates insulin resistance, increases mitochondrial content, and prolongs survival. Here we describe the identification and characterization of small molecule activators of SIRT1 that are structurally unrelated to, and 1,000-fold more potent than, resveratrol. These compounds bind to the SIRT1 enzyme-peptide substrate complex at an allosteric site amino-terminal to the catalytic domain and lower the Michaelis constant for acetylated substrates. In diet-induced obese and genetically obese mice, these compounds improve insulin sensitivity, lower plasma glucose, and increase mitochondrial capacity. In Zucker fa/fa rats, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies demonstrate that SIRT1 activators improve whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Thus, SIRT1 activation is a promising new therapeutic approach for treating diseases of ageing such as type 2 diabetes.",

However, its antioxidative activity and neuroprotective effect were seldom discussed in the embryonic system. In this study, the effect of resveratrol on chicken embryo development under high glucose and its underlying mechanism of resveratrol were investigated. High glucose administrated to chicken embryo at embryonic Day 1 induced stillbirth, growth retardation, and impaired blood vessel development on yolk sac. However, resveratrol supplementation before glucose exposure showed significant effect on decreasing the death rate, developmental damage, and vessel injury. In addition, oxidative stress was caused by high-glucose exposure, and resveratrol could rescue this high-glucose-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, the neural developmental marker paired box 3 was significantly decreased by high glucose and recovered by resveratrol. Cell cycle-regulated gene expression was also intervened by resveratrol. This study had found an association between resveratrol and hyperglycemia-induced embryonic damage, which suggested a potential protective effect of resveratrol on gestational diabetes.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether resveratrol, a polyphenol antioxidant compound, when administered at a dose that can be reasonably obtained through supplementation could prevent the development of cardiovascular complications in older, obese, diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in 6-month old, obese, male Wistar rats via a single intravenous dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). Randomly selected animals were administered resveratrol (2 mg/kg) via oral gavage daily for 8 weeks. Body weights, blood glucose levels, food intake and water consumption were monitored, and assessments of vascular reactivity, tactile allodynia and left ventricular function were performed. Resveratrol therapy significantly improved tactile allodynia and vascular contractile functionality in diabetic rats (P<0·05). There were no significant changes in standardised vasorelaxation responses, plasma glucose concentrations, water consumption, body weight, left ventricular hypertrophy, kidney hypertrophy, heart rate or left ventricular compliance with resveratrol administration. Resveratrol-mediated improvements in vascular and nerve function in old, obese, diabetic rats were associated with its reported antioxidant effects. Resveratrol did not improve cardiac function nor mitigate the classic clinical symptoms of diabetes mellitus (i.e. hyperglycaemia, polydypsia and a failure to thrive). This suggests that supplementation with resveratrol at a dose achievable with commercially available supplements would not produce significant cardioprotective effects in people with diabetes mellitus.",

SIRT1 is a NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent deacetylase that plays a central role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. SIRT1 activators, including plant polyphenols such as resveratrol, improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle tissue. We hypothesised that the novel plant-derived compounds, strigolactone and pinosylvin, beneficially enhance SIRT1 function, insulin signalling, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells. Rat L6 skeletal muscle myotubes were treated with strigolactone analogue GR24 and pinosylvin. Resveratrol was included in experiments as a reference compound. We measured the effects of these compounds on SIRT1 function, insulin signalling, glucose uptake, mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression profiles. Strigolactone GR24 upregulated and activated SIRT1 without activating AMPK, enhanced insulin signalling, glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Pinosylvin activated SIRT1 in vitro and stimulated glucose uptake through the activation of AMPK. The regulation of SIRT1 by strigolactone GR24 and the activation of AMPK by pinosylvin may offer novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.",

Adipose tissue plays a major role in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism.

Therefore, an attempt has been made to investigate the effects of resveratrol and mangiferin on biochemical parameters and molecular mechanism of <i>PPARγ</i> and <i>FALDH</i> gene expression in adipose tissue of streptozotocin- (STZ-) nicotinamide- (NA-) induced diabetic rats. Albino Wister rats were randomly divided into five groups: control rats (Group 1), diabetic control rats (Group 2), diabetic rats given resveratrol (40 mg/kg body weight per day; Group 3), diabetic rats given mangiferin (40 mg/kg body weight per day; Group 4), diabetic rats given glibenclamide (0.6 mg/kg body weight per day; Group 5). Serum biochemical parameters-total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), urea, and uric acid were analyzed. We found that the oral administration of resveratrol and mangiferin to STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats for 30 days showed the significant protective effect on all the biochemical parameters. A significant reduction in blood glucose and HbA1c levels was observed in rats treated with 40 mg/kg body weight per day of resveratrol or mangiferin. Moreover, both these antioxidants showed significant enhancement of <i>PPARγ</i> and <i>FALDH</i> gene expression in rat adipose tissue compared to control rats.",

This randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the tertiary care institute of the NUMS, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A total of 82 adult MetS patients were enrolled and randomly grouped into the TRM group (n = 41) and the Placebo group (n = 41). Patients in the TRM group were given 400 mg capsules (δ-tocotrienol 250 mg; Resveratrol 150 mg) and placebo received (cellulose 400 mg capsule) twice daily for 24 weeks. The TRM supplementation revealed a significant (p < 0.001) upregulation of 3.05-fold in miRNA-130b-5p and 2.45-fold in miRNA-221-5p while miRNA-122-5p was downregulated by 2.22-fold as compared to placebo.

Resveratrol and quercetin are red wine polyphenols with known beneficial cardiovascular properties, including an antioxidant capacity. This study evaluated whether resveratrol and/or quercetin could prevent in vitro-induced diabetic changes in neurogenic and vascular relaxant responses of mouse arteries and corpora cavernosa. Isometric tension of isolated aorta, mesenteric arteries and corpora cavernosa was measured using organ bath systems. Diabetic conditions were mimicked in vitro by co-incubating the tissues for 2 h with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) and MGO (120 µM). The presence of HG and MGO significantly blunted acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxations in corpora cavernosa and mesenteric arteries but not in aorta. Electrical field stimulated (EFS) responses of corpora cavernosa were also significantly inhibited by these diabetic conditions. In corpora cavernosa 2 h co-incubation with resveratrol (30 µM) or quercetin (30 µM) significantly attenuated HG and MGO-induced deficits in Ach- and EFS-responses. Our study demonstrates that in mouse arteries, HG and MGO rather affect endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated than nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxations. In corpora cavernosa HG and MGO interfere with NO release. Resveratrol and quercetin protect mouse corpora cavernosa from diabetic-induced damage to NO-mediated relaxant responses. This might rely on their antioxidant capacity.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease, are two closely related pathological situations that are connected at the molecular level. In recent years, amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin, has been proposed for being a main actor in this context due to its capacity to form aggregates in a β-sheet-like structure. In a diabetic milieu, there is an increase in the production and secretion of insulin and amylin. We have analysed the role of resveratrol on aggregate formation and in the production of extracellular vesicles with amylin in its interior and in pancreatic β cells overexpressing human amylin (INS1E-hIAPP). Furthermore, we have explored the consequences of the exposition of the conditioned medium derived from INS1E-hIAPP in the hippocampal cell line HT-22 and the role of resveratrol in this cell line. Hippocampal cells were exposed to conditioned media obtained from rat insulinoma 1E overexpressing human amylin in the presence or in the absence of resveratrol. When we exposed HT-22 cells to the conditioned media of INS1E-hIAPP we observed amylin-aggregates inside HT-22 cells. Resveratrol was able to alleviate this effect not only in HT-22 but also in pancreatic β cells. Furthermore, resveratrol decreased the average exosome size produced by the INS1E-hIAPP stimulated with high glucose, diminishing the toxic effect of these exosomes in HT-22 cells. We have uncovered that resveratrol inhibits the aggregation capacity of amylin and it can diminish the deleterious spreading of the toxic protein, to other cell types such as the hippocampal neuron cells, HT-22.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether treatment of mice with established pressure overload-induced heart failure (HF) with the naturally occurring polyphenol resveratrol could improve functional symptoms of clinical HF such as fatigue and exercise intolerance. C57Bl/6N mice were subjected to either sham or transverse aortic constriction surgery to induce HF. Three weeks postsurgery, a cohort of mice with established HF (%ejection fraction <45) was administered resveratrol (~450 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup>) or vehicle for 2 wk. Although the percent ejection fraction was similar between both groups of HF mice, those mice treated with resveratrol had increased total physical activity levels and exercise capacity. Resveratrol treatment was associated with altered gut microbiota composition, increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, a switch toward greater whole body glucose utilization, and increased basal metabolic rates. Although muscle mass and strength were not different between groups, mice with HF had significant declines in basal and ADP-stimulated O<sub>2</sub> consumption in isolated skeletal muscle fibers compared with sham mice, which was completely normalized by resveratrol treatment. Overall, resveratrol treatment of mice with established HF enhances exercise performance, which is associated with alterations in whole body and skeletal muscle energy metabolism. Thus, our preclinical data suggest that resveratrol supplementation may effectively improve fatigue and exercise intolerance in HF patients.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Resveratrol treatment of mice with heart failure leads to enhanced exercise performance that is associated with altered gut microbiota composition, increased whole body glucose utilization, and enhanced skeletal muscle metabolism and function. Together, these preclinical data suggest that resveratrol supplementation may effectively improve fatigue and exercise intolerance in heart failure via these mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a carbohydrate-rich diet-regulated ailment with carbohydrates digested and absorbed rapidly. Hence, modulating carbohydrate digestion is warranted; to this end, polyphenols from plant sources are handy. However, polyphenols' instability and low bioavailability limit their wholesome use, and thus, encapsulating them into an inexpensive and suitable wall material would be the best strategy. Herein, the potential of porous starch granules is demonstrated. Curcumin and resveratrol were chosen as the test polyphenols due to their proven health benefits, and porous corn starch granules were chosen as the wall material. Porous corn starch granules were prepared through enzymatic modification with 11, 22, and 33 units of amyloglucosidase at three reaction times of 2, 4, and 6 h. The polyphenols were loaded at 100, 200, and 500 mg concentrations in 1 g of starch for 21 days and were characterized through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The encapsulation efficiency was determined, the rate of starch digestion was calculated through the Englyst test, and polyphenols' in vitro release behavior in gastric and intestinal fluids was measured. Results suggest that 33 enzyme units for a 2 h reaction time were optimal for forming spherical-oval pores on corn starch granules with the maximum encapsulation efficiency of 80.16 % and 88.33 % for curcumin and resveratrol, respectively. The FTIR results suggest the entrapment of polyphenols inside the starch matrix. The inclusion significantly reduced starch digestion and increased the percentage of resistant starch up to 41.11 % and 66.36 % with curcumin and resveratrol, respectively. The in vitro release behavior demonstrated good stability in the simulated gastric fluids and sustained release in simulated intestinal fluids. The encapsulated polyphenols showed a complex Fickian type of diffusion mechanism. Overall, the results suggest that porous corn starch granules could be a potential delivery system for curcumin and resveratrol and will aid in developing novel functional foods to address the T2DM concerns.",

Resveratrol (RSV) upregulates APN multimerization in adipocytes, but whether RSV improves endogenous APN multimerization and thus attenuates MI/R injury in T2DM mice has never been investigated. T2DM mice were treated with 10 mg/kg RSV daily for 3 weeks, followed by 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia and 3 hours or 24 hours of reperfusion. RSV administration alleviated MI/R injury in diabetic mice, as evidenced by reduced infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity, and improved cardiac function. Moreover, RSV reversed the downregulated APN levels and multimerization both in plasma and adipose tissue, accompanied by increased disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) expression in T2DM mice. Conversely, serving as a key downstream molecule of APN in ameliorating MI/R injury, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) significantly attenuated the cardioprotective effects of RSV. In conclusion, long-term administration of RSV upregulates adiponectin levels and multimerization in T2DM mice, consequently attenuating MI/R injury partially through APN-AMPK signaling.",

      "abstract": "Effective and safe pharmacological interventions for hyperlipidemia remains badly needed. By incorporating the key pharmacophore of fibrates into the natural scaffold of resveratrol, a novel structural compound ZBH was constructed. In present study, we found ZBH reserved approximately one third of the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation produced by resveratrol at in-vitro enzyme activity assay, directly bound to and activated all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subtypes respectively in PPAR binding and transactivation assays. Moreover, ZBH (EC₅₀, 1.75 µM) activate PPARα 21 fold more efficiently than the well-known PPAR pan agonist bezafibrate (EC₅₀ 37.37 µM) in the cellular transactivation assays. In the high fat diet induced hyperlipidemic hamsters, 5-week treatment with ZBH significantly lowered serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-C, FFA, hyperinsulinemia, and improved insulin sensitivity more potently than bezafibrate. Meanwhile, serum transaminases, creatine phosphokinase and CREA levels were found not altered by ZBH intervention. Mechanism study indicated ZBH promoted the expression of PPARα target genes and SIRT1 mRNA. Hepatic lipogenesis was markedly decreased via down-regulation of lipogenic genes, and fatty acid uptake and oxidation was simultaneously increased in the liver and skeletal muscle via up-regulation of lipolysis genes. Glucose uptake and utilization was also significantly promoted in skeletal muscle. These results suggested that ZBH significantly lowered hyperlipidemia and ameliorated insulin resistance more efficiently than bezafibrate in the hyperlipidemic hamsters primarily by activating of PPARα, and SIRT1 promotion and activation. ZBH thus presents a potential new agent to combat hyperlipidemia.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of AM on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR) in comparison with resveratrol (RSV) treatment. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: standard chow diet (control group), high-fat diet (model group), HFD + abdominal massage (AM group), and HFD + resveratrol (RSV group). A rat model of IR was established by feeding HFD to rats for 8 weeks followed by treatment with AM or RSV for 4 weeks. The underlying HFD-induced IR molecular mechanisms were studied in rat serum and skeletal muscles. RSV and AM significantly improved glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, obesity, and significantly reduced lipid accumulation [triglyceride (TC), total cholesterol (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)], adipocytokine [free fatty acids (FFA), adiponectin (ADPN)] and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) secretion. In addition, AM activated the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in rat skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our results showed that AM could improve IR by regulating the secretion of adipocytokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as related signaling pathways in the skeletal muscle of rats, which might provide insights into development of new treatment methods for the clinical treatment of IR.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RESV), a polyphenolic natural compound, has long been acknowledged to have cardioprotective and antiinflammatory actions. Evidence suggests that RESV has antioxidant properties that reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress and apoptotic death of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent literature has recognized hyperglycemia as a cause of oxidative stress reported to be harmful for the nervous system. In this context, our study aimed (a) to evaluate the effect of RESV against high glucose (HG)-induced oxidative stress in DAergic neurons, (b) to study the antiapoptotic properties of RESV in HG condition, and c) to analyze RESV's ability to modulate p53 and GRP75, a p53 inactivator found to be under expressed in postmortem PD brains. Our results suggest that RESV protects DAergic neurons against HG-induced oxidative stress by diminishing cellular levels of superoxide anion. Moreover, RESV significantly reduces HG-induced apoptosis in DAergic cells by modulating DNA fragmentation and the expression of several genes implicated in the apoptotic cascade, such as Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP-1. RESV also prevents the pro-apoptotic increase of p53 in the nucleus induced by HG. Such data strengthens the correlation between hyperglycemia and neurodegeneration, while providing new insight on the high occurrence of PD in patients with diabetes. This study enlightens potent neuroprotective roles for RESV that should be considered as a nutritional recommendation for preventive and/or complementary therapies in controlling neurodegenerative complications in diabetes.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on metabolism and the function of blood platelets under static and in in vitro flow conditions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Blood obtained from 8 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with type 2 diabetes was incubated with resveratrol and perfused over collagen-coated capillaries. Isolated blood platelets were incubated with resveratrol and activated by collagen to assess platelet function, metabolism, ATP release, TXA<sub>2</sub> production, lipid peroxidation, and gluthatione content. In the type 2 diabetes group, plasma glucose and fructosamine concentrations were significantly higher than in the healthy group. In in vitro studies, collagen-induced thrombi formation in the blood of diabetic patients was 33% higher than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced thrombi by over 50% in the blood of healthy and diabetic patients. TXA<sub>2</sub> production was 47% higher in diabetic platelets than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced TXA<sub>2</sub> release by 38% in healthy platelets and by 79% in diabetic platelets. Resveratrol also reduced the activities of enzymes responsible for glycolysis and oxidative metabolism in the platelets of both groups. These data indicate that the resveratrol-induced inhibition of platelet metabolism and TXA<sub>2</sub> release may lead to a reduction of platelet function and thrombus formation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, resveratrol may be beneficial to prevent vascular complications as a future complementary treatment in aspirin-resistant diabetic patients.",

Its role on pentraxin 3 (PTX3) concentrations, a human acute phase protein, has never been evaluated. Our aim was to determine whether a two-dosage resveratrol supplementation (500 and 40 mg/day) has an impact on PTX3 values in T2DM patients from a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Variations in total antioxidant status (TAS) were evaluated too. A total of 192 T2DM patients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500 mg/day (Resv 500 arm), resveratrol 40 mg/day (Resv 40 arm) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and at the trial end, PTX3 and TAS values were determined. A dose-dependent increase in PTX3 concentrations of 4.7% (Resv 40 arm) and 26.3% (Resv 500 arm), and 8.0% reduction after placebo were found. Adjusted mean differences of change versus placebo were 0.16 (95% CI 0.01-0.32) and 0.25 (0.09-0.42) in the Resv 40 and Resv 500 arms, respectively. At subgroup analyses, lower diabetes duration, aspirin, alcohol use, younger age, female gender, smoking (Resv 500 arm) and female gender and aspirin use (Resv 40 arm) were associated with higher PTX3 increments. A dose-dependent increment in TAS values in the resveratrol arms (1.4 and 6.4% for Resv 40 and Resv 500, respectively), and a reduction in placebo arm (-8.9%) were observed. Adjusted mean differences of change were 28.5 (95% CI 10.1-46.8) and 44.8 (25.4-64.1) in the Resv 40 and Resv 500 arms, respectively.

Seventeen subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) were treated with placebo and 150 mg/day resveratrol (resVida) in a randomized double-blind crossover study for 30 days. The main outcome measure was insulin sensitivity by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not affected by resveratrol treatment. Intrahepatic lipid content also remained unaffected by resveratrol; however, the change in intrahepatic lipid content correlated negatively with plasma resveratrol levels (R = -0.68, P = 0.03). Intramyocellular lipid content increased in type 2 muscle fibers (P = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure tended to decrease (P = 0.09) upon resveratrol treatment. In addition, resveratrol significantly improved ex vivo mitochondrial function (state 3 and state U respiration upon malate with octanoyl-carnitine, P < 0.005). Intriguingly, a correlation was found between plasma levels of a metabolite of resveratrol (dihydroresveratrol) and the metformin dose used by the patients (R = 0.66, P = 0.005), suggesting an interaction between metformin and resveratrol. It could be speculated that the lack of a resveratrol-induced insulin-sensitizing effect is caused by this interaction. Resveratrol supplementation does not improve hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our results question the generalized value of resveratrol as an add-on therapy in the treatment of T2D and emphasize the need to perform studies in drug-naive patients with T2D or subjects with prediabetes.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol supplementation improves metabolic health in healthy obese men, but not in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) when given as add-on therapy. Therefore, we examined whether resveratrol can enhance metabolic health in men at risk of developing T2D. Additionally, we examined if resveratrol can stimulate brown adipose tissue (BAT). Thirteen male first degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T2D received resveratrol (150 mg/day) and placebo for 30 days in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over trial. Resveratrol significantly improved ex vivo muscle mitochondrial function on a fatty acid-derived substrate. However, resveratrol did not improve insulin sensitivity, expressed as the rate of glucose disposal during a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Also, intrahepatic and intramyocellular lipid content, substrate utilization, energy metabolism, and cold-stimulated <sup>18</sup>F-FDG glucose uptake in BAT (n = 8) remained unaffected by resveratrol. In vitro experiments in adipocytes derived from human BAT confirmed the lack of effect on BAT. Resveratrol stimulates muscle mitochondrial function in FDR males, which is in concordance with previous results. However, no other metabolic benefits of resveratrol were found in this group. This could be attributed to subject characteristics causing alterations in metabolism of resveratrol and thereby affecting resveratrol's effectiveness. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02129595.",

We herein aim to evaluate whether an increase in SIRT-1 expression affects histone 3 acetylation at the 56 lysine residue (H3K56ac) in T2DM patients randomly selected to receive either resveratrol (40 mg or 500 mg) or a placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome is changes in the H3K56ac level by variation in SIRT-1 expression and the secondary outcome is the evidence of association between SIRT-1 level, antioxidant markers (TAS), and metabolic variables. At baseline, peripheral blood mononuclear cell H3K56ac values among the SIRT-1 tertiles did not differ. At trial end, SIRT-1 levels were significantly higher in patients receiving 500 mg resveratrol. At follow-up, patients were divided into tertiles of delta (trial end minus baseline) SIRT-1 value. Significant reductions in H3K56ac and body fat percentage were found in the highest tertile as were increased TAS levels. A multiple logistic regression model showed that the highest delta SIRT-1 tertile was inversely associated with variations in H3K56ac (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.99), TAS (OR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02), and body fat percentage (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.96). We provide new knowledge on H3K56ac and SIRT-1 association in T2DM. These data suggest that boosting SIRT-1 expression/activation may impact redox homeostasis in these patients.

We evaluated the effects of 5 wk of resveratrol treatment on GLP-1 secretion, gastric emptying, and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Fourteen patients with diet-controlled type-2 diabetes [mean ± SEM glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 6.4 ± 0.2% (46.4 ± 2.2 mmol/mol)] received resveratrol (500 mg twice daily) or a placebo over two 5-wk intervention periods with a 5-wk washout period in between in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Before and after each intervention period (4 visits), body weight and HbA1c were measured, and patients were evaluated after an overnight fast with a standardized mashed-potato meal labeled with 100 μg (13)C-octanoic acid to measure blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 concentrations and gastric emptying (breath test) over 240 min. Daily energy intake was estimated from 3-d food diaries during the week before each visit. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose and plasma total GLP-1 as well as gastric emptying were similar at each assessment, and the change in each variable from weeks 0 to 5 did not differ between resveratrol and placebo groups. Similarly, changes in HbA1c, daily energy intake, and body weight after 5 wk did not differ between the 2 treatments. In patients with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes, 5 wk of twice-daily 500 mg-resveratrol supplementation had no effect on GLP-1 secretion, glycemic control, gastric emptying, body weight, or energy intake.

A total of 48 patients with T2D randomly were assigned to receive 800 mg/day resveratrol or placebo for 2 months. Plasma total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde concentration, protein carbonyl and total thiol contents, intracellular superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>·) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in PBMCs, the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress responses (Nrf2, SOD, Cat, HO-1, RAGE, NOS) in PBMCs, and metabolic and anthropometric parameters were measured at the baseline and at the trial end. Compared with the placebo group, resveratrol reduced plasma protein carbonyl content and PBMCs O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>· level and significantly increased plasma total antioxidant capacity and total thiol content. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 and SOD was significantly increased after resveratrol consumption. Resveratrol had no significant effects on the metabolic and anthropometric parameters except for a significant reduction in weight, BMI, and blood pressure levels. Resveratrol was well tolerated, and no serious adverse event was occurred.

      "abstract": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound. Numerous animal studies have been reported on its wide-ranging beneficial effects in the biological system including diabetes mellitus (DM). We hypothesized, therefore, that oral supplementation of resveratrol would improve the glycemic control and the associated risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present clinical study was therefore carried out to test the hypothesis. Sixty-two patients with T2DM were enrolled from Government Headquarters Hospital, Ootacamund, India, in a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into control and intervention groups. The control group received only oral hypoglycemic agents, whereas the intervention group received resveratrol (250 mg/d) along with their oral hypoglycemic agents for a period of 3 months. Hemoglobin A(1c), lipid profile, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and protein were measured at the baseline and at the end of 3 months. The results reveal that supplementation of resveratrol for 3 months significantly improves the mean hemoglobin A(1c) (means ± SD, 9.99 ± 1.50 vs 9.65 ± 1.54; P < .05), systolic blood pressure (mean ± SD, 139.71 ± 16.10 vs 127.92 ± 15.37; P < .05), total cholesterol (mean ± SD, 4.70 ± 0.90 vs 4.33 ± 0.76; P < .05), and total protein (mean ± SD, 75.6 ± 4.6 vs 72.3 ± 6.2; P < .05) in T2DM. No significant changes in body weight and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols were observed. Oral supplementation of resveratrol is thus found to be effective in improving glycemic control and may possibly provide a potential adjuvant for the treatment and management of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Poor cerebral perfusion may contribute to cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that resveratrol can enhance cerebral vasodilator function and thereby alleviate the cognitive deficits in T2DM. We have already reported that acute resveratrol consumption improved cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to hypercapnia. We now report the effects of resveratrol on neurovascular coupling capacity (CVR to cognitive stimuli), cognitive performance and correlations with plasma resveratrol concentrations. Thirty-six T2DM adults aged 40-80 years were randomized to consume single doses of resveratrol (0, 75, 150 and 300 mg) at weekly intervals. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to monitor changes in blood flow velocity (BFV) during a cognitive test battery. The battery consisted of dual-tasking (finger tapping with both Trail Making task and Serial Subtraction 3 task) and a computerized multi-tasking test that required attending to four tasks simultaneously. CVR to cognitive tasks was calculated as the per cent increase in BFV from pre-test basal to peak mean blood flow velocity and also as the area under the curve for BFV. Compared to placebo, 75 mg resveratrol significantly improved neurovascular coupling capacity, which correlated with plasma total resveratrol levels. Enhanced performance on the multi-tasking test battery was also evident following 75 mg and 300 mg of resveratrol. a single 75 mg dose of resveratrol was able to improve neurovascular coupling and cognitive performance in T2DM. Evaluation of benefits of chronic resveratrol supplementation is now warranted.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol has been reported to have potent anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal studies. However, there are few interventional studies in human patients with atherosclerogenic diseases. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) reflects arterial stiffness and is a clinical surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol on arterial stiffness assessed by CAVI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 50 patients with T2DM received supplement of a 100mg resveratrol tablet (total resveratrol: oligo-stilbene 27.97 mg/100 mg/day) or placebo daily for 12 weeks. CAVI was assessed at baseline and the end of study. Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), glucose and lipid metabolic parameters, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs; an oxidative stress marker) were also measured.Resveratrol supplementation decreased systolic BP (-5.5 ± 13.0 mmHg), d-ROMs (-25.6 ± 41.8 U.CARR), and CAVI (-0.4 ± 0.7) significantly (P < 0.05) and decreased BW (-0.8 ± 2.1 kg, P = 0.083) and body mass index (-0.5 ± 0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.092) slightly compared to baseline, while there were no significant changes in the placebo group. Decreases in CAVI and d-ROMs were significantly greater in the resveratrol group than in the placebo group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified resveratrol supplementation as an independent predictor for a CAVI decrease of more than 0.5.In conclusion, 12-week resveratrol supplementation may improve arterial stiffness and reduce oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. Resveratrol may be beneficial in preventing the development of atherosclerosis induced by diabetes. However, a large-scale cohort study is required to validate the present findings.",

      "abstract": "The primary aims of the study were to examine the effect of resveratrol on skeletal muscle SIRT1 expression and energy expenditure in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Animal and in vivo studies indicate that resveratrol increases SIRT1 expression that stimulates PGC1α activity. Subsequent upregulation of AMPK and GLUT4 expression are associated with improved insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Ten subjects with T2DM were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive 3g resveratrol or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include measures of AMPK, p-AMPK and GLUT4 expression levels, energy expenditure, physical activity levels, distribution of abdominal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle fiber type composition, body weight, HbA1c, plasma lipid subfraction, adiponectin levels, and insulin sensitivity. There was a significant increase in both SIRT1 expression (2.01 vs. 0.86 arbitrary units [AU], p = .016) and p-AMPK to AMPK expression ratio (2.04 vs. 0.79 AU, p = .032) in the resveratrol group compared with the placebo group. Although the percentage of absolute change (8.6 vs. -13.9%, p = .033) and percentage of predicted resting metabolic rate (RMR; 7.8 vs. -13.9%, p = .013) were increased following resveratrol, there was a significant reduction in average daily activity (-38 vs. 43.2%, p = .028) and step counts (-39.5 vs. 11.8%, p = .047) when compared with placebo. In patients with T2DM, treatment with resveratrol regulates energy expenditure through increased skeletal muscle SIRT1 and AMPK expression. These findings indicate that resveratrol may have beneficial exercise-mimetic effects in patients with T2DM.",

Its benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are controversial. Our aims were to determine whether resveratrol supplementation at two different dosages (500 and 40mg/day) for 6 months i) reduced the concentrations of C-reactive-protein (CRP) and ii) ameliorated the metabolic pattern of T2DM patients. In the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 192 T2DM patients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500mg/day (Resv500arm), resveratrol 40mg/day (Resv40arm) or placebo for 6-months. At baseline and at the trial end, CRP values, anthropometric, metabolic and liver parameters were determined. No serious adverse event occurred. A dose-dependent, though not significant, CRP decrease of 5.6% (Resv40arm) and 15.9% (Resv500arm) was observed vs placebo. We failed to detect significant differences in weight, BMI, waist circumference, and values of arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids, liver transaminases, uric acid, adiponectin, interleukin-6, in both the Resv500 and Resv40 arms vs placebo. Total cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased in the Resv500arm. Subgroup analyses revealed that lower diabetes duration (in both Resv500 and Resv40arms), and, in the Resv500arm, younger age, aspirin use and being a smoker were associated with a significantly higher CRP reduction vs placebo. The supplementations with 40mg/day or 500mg/day resveratrol did neither reduce CRP concentrations, nor improve the metabolic pattern of T2DM patients.",

Our aims were to determine whether the polyphenol resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients and to gain some insight into the mechanism of its action. After an initial general examination (including blood chemistry), nineteen patients enrolled in the 4-week-long double-blind study were randomly assigned into two groups: a resveratrol group receiving oral 2 × 5 mg resveratrol and a control group receiving placebo. Before and after the second and fourth weeks of the trial, insulin resistance/sensitivity, creatinine-normalised ortho-tyrosine level in urine samples (as a measure of oxidative stress), incretin levels and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt):protein kinase B (Akt) ratio in platelets were assessed and statistically analysed. After the fourth week, resveratrol significantly decreased insulin resistance (homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance) and urinary ortho-tyrosine excretion, while it increased the pAkt:Akt ratio in platelets. On the other hand, it had no effect on parameters that relate to β-cell function (i.e. homeostasis model of assessment of β-cell function). The present study shows for the first time that resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity in humans, which might be due to a resveratrol-induced decrease in oxidative stress that leads to a more efficient insulin signalling via the Akt pathway.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that resveratrol (RES) exerts anti-inflammatory effects but human trials evidencing these effects in vivo are limited. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms triggered in humans following the oral intake of RES are not yet understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) associated to the one-year daily intake of a RES enriched (8 mg) grape extract (GE-RES) in hypertensive male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We used microarrays and RT-PCR to analyze expression changes in genes and microRNAs (miRs) involved in the inflammatory response modulated by the consumption of GE-RES in comparison to a placebo and GE lacking RES. We also examined the changes in several serobiochemical variables, inflammatory and fibrinolytic markers. Our results showed that supplementation with GE or GE-RES did not affect body weight, blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c or lipids, beyond the values regulated by gold standard medication in these patients. We did not find either any significant change on serum inflammatory markers except for a significant reduction of ALP and IL-6 levels. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3, IL-1β and TNF-α was significantly reduced and that of the transcriptional repressor LRRFIP-1 increased in PBMCs from patients taking the GE-RES extract. Also, a group of miRs involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response: miR-21, miR-181b, miR-663, miR-30c2, miR-155 and miR-34a were found to be highly correlated and altered in the group consuming the GE-RES for 12 months. Our results provide preliminary evidence that long-term supplementation with a grape extract containing RES downregulates the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines with the involvement of inflammation-related miRs in circulating immune cells of T2DM hypertensive medicated patients and support a beneficial immunomodulatory effect in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) extends the lifespan of diverse species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In these organisms, lifespan extension is dependent on Sir2, a conserved deacetylase proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. Here we show that resveratrol shifts the physiology of middle-aged mice on a high-calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard diet and significantly increases their survival. Resveratrol produces changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) levels, increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high-calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways. These data show that improving general health in mammals using small molecules is an attainable goal, and point to new approaches for treating obesity-related disorders and diseases of ageing.",

Circadian rhythm disruption contributes to type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. We elucidated whether altered circadian rhythmicity of clock genes is associated with metabolic dysfunction in T2D. Transcriptional cycling of core-clock genes <i>BMAL1, CLOCK</i>, and <i>PER3</i> was altered in skeletal muscle from individuals with T2D, and this was coupled with reduced number and amplitude of cycling genes and disturbed circadian oxygen consumption. Inner mitochondria–associated genes were enriched for rhythmic peaks in normal glucose tolerance, but not T2D, and positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing identified CLOCK and BMAL1 binding to inner-mitochondrial genes associated with insulin sensitivity, implicating regulation by the core clock. Inner-mitochondria disruption altered core-clock gene expression and free-radical production, phenomena that were restored by resveratrol treatment. We identify bidirectional communication between mitochondrial function and rhythmic gene expression, processes that are disturbed in diabetes.",

Additionally, we sought to assess the therapeutic potential of resveratrol (RSV) as a remedy for arsenic-induced diabetes, using metformin (MF) as a standard drug for comparison. We measured the total arsenic content in mouse serum by employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after administering a 50-ppm solution of sodium arsenate (50 mg/L) in purified water. Our findings revealed a substantial increase in total arsenic content in the exposed group, with a mean value of 166.80 ± 8.52 ppb (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, we investigated the impact of arsenic exposure on various biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Arsenic exposed mice exhibited significant hyperglycemia (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and elevated levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hemoglobin A1c (Hb1Ac), Inflammatory biomarkers as well as liver and kidney function biomarkers (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, the levels of crucial enzymes linked to carbohydrate metabolism, including α-glucosidase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PS), and oxidative stress biomarkers, such as levels of glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were significantly reduced in the arsenic-exposed group compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, the level of MDA was significantly increased. Molecular analysis of gene expression indicated significant upregulation of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, such as carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-I (CPT-I), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-II (CPT-II), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and others. Additionally, alterations in gene expression related to glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), and glucokinase (GK), associated with carbohydrate metabolism, were observed. Amino acid analysis revealed significant decreases in nine amino acids in arsenic-exposed mice. Metabolomics analysis identified disruptions in lipid metabolomes, amino acids, and arsenic metabolites, highlighting their involvement in essential metabolic pathways. Histopathological observations revealed significant changes in liver architecture, hepatocyte degeneration, and increased Kupffer cells in the livers of arsenic-exposed mice. In conclusion, these findings enhance our comprehension of the impact of environmental toxins on metabolic health and offer potential avenues for remedies against such disruptions.",

UPR sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum, IRE1α and PERK, bind and are activated by proteins with unexpected surface hydrophobicity, whereas sensor ATF6 is activated by proteolytic cleavage when released from complexation with protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). Metabolic dysfunction leading to the formation of misfolded proteins with surface hydrophobicity and disruption of ATF6-PDI complexes leading to activation of UPR sensors remains unclear. The cellular concentration of reactive dicarbonyl metabolite, methylglyoxal (MG), is increased in impaired metabolic health, producing increased MG-modified cellular proteins. Herein we assessed the effect of high glucose concentration and related increased cellular MG on activation status of IRE1α, PERK and ATF6. Human aortal endothelial cells and HMEC-1 microvascular endothelial cells were incubated in low and high glucose concentration to model blood glucose control, with increase or decrease of MG by silencing or increasing expression of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), which metabolizes MG. Increased MG induced by high glucose concentration activated IRE1α, PERK and ATF6 and related downstream signalling leading to increased chaperone, apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression. Correction of increased MG by increasing Glo1 expression prevented UPR activation. MG modification of proteins produces surface hydrophobicity through arginine-derived hydroimidazolone MG-H1 formation, with related protein unfolding and preferentially targets PDIs and chaperone pathways for modification. It thereby poses a major challenge to proteostasis and activates UPR sensors. Pharmacological decrease of MG with Glo1 inducer, trans-resveratrol and hesperetin in combination, offers a novel treatment strategy to counter UPR-related cell dysfunction, particularly in hyperglycemia associated with diabetes.",

This peptide regulates appetite, the immune system, vascular functions and insulin sensitivity. Zinc (Zn) and resveratrol (RES) have potential effects on adipose tissue. Objective: to know if the combined administration of Zn and RES has any effect on blood leptin quantification in obese people. Methods: longitudinal experimental study, controlled clinical trial design, randomized, double blind. Randomized formation of four groups: T1 (Zn 50 mg), T2 (control), T3 (RES 500 mg), T4 (Zn 50 mg and RES 500 mg) with a supplementation period of 60 days. Blood samples were taken and glucose (GLU), leptin (LEP) and lipids (HDL, LDL, TGL) were quantified before and after exposure to the study elements. Results: age 34 (± 7) years. In T-tests, significance in GLU (p = 0.04) and LEP (p = 0.055). By exposure groups: GLU at T1 (p = 0.03) and T2 (p = 0.031); at LEP at T4 (p = 0.024). Lipids by groups: HDL at T3 (p = 0.039) and T4 (p = 0.014). ANOVA, HDL (p = 0.06). Pearson, HDL (p = 0.07) and LDL (p = 0.09). Conclusion: zinc and resveratrol showed promise as agents in modulating leptin and glucose signaling, confirming that they work in a proportional manner and provide benefits for cardiac health, but more exposure time is needed to see if they impact energy balance homeostasis.",

Searching for therapeutic agents acting on oxidative stress, adipogenesis and insulin resistance is considered as an efficient approach to control obesity-related diseases. The present study was designed to examine the in vitro and in vivo effects of dihydro-resveratrol (DR2), a naturally occurring compound from <i>Dendrobium</i> medicinal plants, on oxidative stress aggravation, adipogenesis, lipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. We utilized an in vitro 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation model to show that DR2 could reduce pre-adipocyte maturation by activation of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling proteins to inhibit p38MAPK proteins. With the use of in vitro oxidative-stress-induced hepatocytes and myoblasts models, DR2 was also shown to be able to reduce oxidative stress aggravation through mediation of Nrf2-related antioxidative cascade, reduce intracellular lipid accumulation through phosphorylation of ACC protein, reduce lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes and promote insulin sensitivity via activation of AKT protein in the insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and C2C12 cells. The effects of DR2 on adipogenesis, lipid accumulation, insulin resistance and blood glucose clearance were further demonstrated in the high-fat diet-induced obesity mouse model. Our in vitro and in vivo studies determined that DR2 could contain therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of PIC and RSV on parameters affecting inflammation, oxidative stress, and sirtuins (Sirt). Male C57BL/6J mice, 20 weeks old, were assigned to the following groups; (1) lean control, (2) high-fat diet control (HF), (3) HF_PIC, and (4) HF_RSV. Oral administration of PIC and RSV (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks improved glucose control as shown by decreasing levels of area under the curve (AUC) during the oral glucose tolerance test compared with HF group. PIC improved glycemic control by increasing hepatic levels of insulin receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase. PIC increased the levels of Sirt1, Sirt3, and Sirt6 and also increased two downstream targets of Sirt, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and forkhead box O1, in the liver. The inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, in the liver were downregulated by RSV treatment. Exposure to PIC and RSV significantly lowered hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, PIC and RSV treatments showed minimal effects on hepatic markers of oxidative stress. The levels of antioxidant enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), were only increased in livers of RSV-treated mice compared with HF control mice. In conclusion, PIC was superior to an equal concentration of RSV in the regulation of Sirt and its downstream targets as well as insulin signaling-related parameters, while RSV potentially suppressed levels of proinflammatory markers and increased NQO1 protein levels.",

C2C12 skeletal myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with resveratrol 0.2 μM, HMB 5 μM, and metformin 0.1 mM alone or in combination. db/db mice were treated for 2 weeks with high (1.5 g/kg diet), low (0.75 g/kg diet), or very low (0.25 g/kg diet) doses of metformin alone or in combination with a diet containing resveratrol 12.5 mg and CaHMB 2 g/kg. The combination of metformin-resveratrol-HMB significantly increased fat oxidation, AMP-activated protein kinase, and Sirt1 activity in muscle cells compared with metformin or resveratrol-HMB alone. A similar trend was found in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In mice, the two lower doses of metformin exerted no independent effect but, when combined with resveratrol-HMB, both low-dose and very low-dose metformin improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA(IR)), plasma insulin levels, and insulin tolerance test response to a level comparable with that found for high-dose metformin. In addition, the metformin-resveratrol-HMB combination decreased visceral fat and liver weight in mice. Resveratrol-HMB combined with metformin may act synergistically on AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways, leading to increased insulin sensitivity, which may reduce the therapeutic doses of metformin necessary in the treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Despite decades of research, obesity and its related medical complications remain a major health concern globally. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to combat obesity and its numerous debilitating complications. Resveratrol (RES) has a potential therapeutic effect in obesity and diabetes by improving oxidative metabolism and insulin signaling. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RES treatment on weight loss and glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Methods: Obesity was induced in 24 mice by exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Mice were randomly assigned to one group of either: group 1: control, non-treated low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks (n = 8), group 2: non-treated high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks (n = 8), group 3: RES-treated HFD (HFD + RES) (n = 8), or group 4: RES-treated and switched to LFD (HFD-LFD + RES) (n = 8). HFD + RES mice were first fed an HFD for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of RES. The HFD-LFD + RES group was first fed an HFD for 8 weeks and then treated with RES and switched to an LFD for 4 weeks. Results: After 12 weeks, group 2 mice had significantly higher body weights compared to group 1 (23.71 ± 1.95 vs. 47.83 ± 2.27; p < 0.05). Group 4 had a significant decrease in body weight and improvement in glucose tolerance compared to mice in group 2 (71.3 ± 1.17 vs. 46.1 ± 1.82 and 40.9 ± 1.75, respectively; p < 0.05). Skeletal muscles expression of SIRT1, SIRT3, and PGC1α were induced in group 3 and 4 mice compared to group 2 (p < 0.01), with no changes in AMP-activated protein kinase expression levels. Furthermore, combination of RES and diet ameliorated skeletal muscle intermediate lipid accumulation and significantly improved insulin sensitivity and secretion. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest a synergistic beneficial effect of LFD and RES to lower body weight and enhance glucose and fatty acid metabolism.",

SIRT1 has been reported to be involved in the processes of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. However, whether SIRT1 is directly involved in insulin sensitivity is still largely unknown. Here we show that SIRT1 is downregulated in insulin-resistant cells and tissues and that knockdown or inhibition of SIRT1 induces insulin resistance. Furthermore, increased expression of SIRT1 improved insulin sensitivity, especially under insulin-resistant conditions. Similarly, resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, enhanced insulin sensitivity in vitro in a SIRT1-dependent manner and attenuated high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance in vivo at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day. Further studies demonstrated that the effect of SIRT1 on insulin resistance is mediated by repressing PTP1B transcription at the chromatin level. Taken together, the finding that SIRT1 improves insulin sensitivity has implications toward resolving insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

However, regulation of PAK2 by RSV in neuronal insulin signaling pathway, if any, is still unknown. In the present study, RSV treatment significantly increased PAK2 activity under insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant condition, along with a marked decrease in glucose uptake in differentiated N2A cells. Pretreatment with AMPK inhibitor, followed by RSV treatment resulted in reduction in PAK2 activity whereas glucose uptake showed an increase. However, pretreatment with Akt inhibitor and then RSV exposure significantly increased PAK2 activity, with a corresponding decrease in glucose uptake. RSV treatment increased AMPK activity and decreased Akt activity. In conclusion, RSV negatively regulates neuronal glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity via PAK2.",

We hypothesized that increasing expression of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1)-an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of reactive metabolite and glycating agent methylglyoxal-may improve metabolic and vascular health. Dietary bioactive compounds were screened for Glo1 inducer activity in a functional reporter assay, hits were confirmed in cell culture, and an optimized Glo1 inducer formulation was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial in 29 overweight and obese subjects. We found trans-resveratrol (tRES) and hesperetin (HESP), at concentrations achieved clinically, synergized to increase Glo1 expression. In highly overweight subjects (BMI >27.5 kg/m(2)), tRES-HESP coformulation increased expression and activity of Glo1 (27%, P < 0.05) and decreased plasma methylglyoxal (-37%, P < 0.05) and total body methylglyoxal-protein glycation (-14%, P < 0.01). It decreased fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (-5%, P < 0.01, and -8%, P < 0.03, respectively), increased oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (42 mL ⋅ min(-1) ⋅ m(-2), P < 0.02), and improved arterial dilatation Δbrachial artery flow-mediated dilatation/Δdilation response to glyceryl nitrate (95% CI 0.13-2.11). In all subjects, it decreased vascular inflammation marker soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (-10%, P < 0.01). In previous clinical evaluations, tRES and HESP individually were ineffective. tRES-HESP coformulation could be a suitable treatment for improved metabolic and vascular health in overweight and obese populations.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the protective effects of resveratrol against metabolic alterations associated with a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD). Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: control (cont.), metabolic syndrome (MS), resveratrol (Res), and metabolic syndrome treated with resveratrol (MS + Res). Resveratrol was administrated orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg·bw, daily. After 10 weeks, body weight, serum biochemical parameters, hepatic oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, as well as mRNA levels of hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism and insulin signaling were measured. In addition, the liver was examined histopathologically to detect lipid deposition. Increased body weight, hepatic dysfunction, dyslipidemia, hepatic insulin resistance, hepatic oxidative and inflammatory stress conditions, upregulation of mRNA expression level of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1-c (SREBP1-c), and downregulation of mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferated activated receptor alpha (PPAR<i>α</i>) and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IR-S2) were all observed in the MS rats. Hepatic steatosis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin and Oil Red O staining. Administration of resveratrol reduced liver steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory state. Also, it improved lipid profile as well as insulin sensitivity and reverted alterations in hepatic mRNA expression levels of the tested genes. Based on these findings, resveratrol could be proposed as a therapeutic approach for MS prevention.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary resveratrol (RES) on placental function and reproductive performance during late pregnancy in a sow model from the aspects of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota. A total of 26 hybrid pregnant sows (Landrace × Yorkshire) with similar parity were randomly allocated into two groups (<i>n</i> = 13) and fed with a basal diet or a diet containing 200 mg/kg of resveratrol from day 85 of gestation until parturition. The dietary supplementation of RES increased the litter weight at parturition by 12.53% (<i>p</i> = 0.145), with ameliorated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), increased triglyceride (TG) levels, and decreased interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels in serum (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, resveratrol increased the placental vascular density (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with the enhanced expression of nutrient transporter genes (<i>SLC2A1</i> and <i>SLC2A3</i>) and antioxidant genes, such as <i>superoxide dismutase 2</i> (<i>SOD2</i>) and <i>heme oxygenase-1</i> (<i>HO-1</i>) but declined the expression of inflammatory genes, such as <i>IL-1</i>β and <i>IL-6</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The characterization of the fecal microbiota revealed that resveratrol decreased the relative abundance of the <i>Christensensllaceae R-7 group</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-008</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05), which had a positive linear correlation with the expression of <i>IL-1</i>β and <i>IL-6</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05), but had a negative linear correlation with the expression of <i>SOD2, HO-1, SLC2A1</i>, and <i>SCL2A3</i> genes (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

Also unknown are possible distinguishing features of cardiac autophagy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In hearts from streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice, diastolic function was impaired, though autophagic activity was significantly increased, as evidenced by increases in microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3 and LC3-II/-I ratios, SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and CTSD (cathepsin D), and by the abundance of autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes detected electron-microscopically. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated and ATP content was reduced in type 1 diabetic hearts. Treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, worsened cardiac performance in type 1 diabetes. In addition, hearts from db/db type 2 diabetic model mice exhibited poorer diastolic function than control hearts from db/+ mice. However, levels of LC3-II, SQSTM1 and phosphorylated MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) were increased, but CTSD was decreased and very few lysosomes were detected ultrastructurally, despite the abundance of autophagic vacuoles. AMPK activity was suppressed and ATP content was reduced in type 2 diabetic hearts. These findings suggest the autophagic process is suppressed at the final digestion step in type 2 diabetic hearts. Resveratrol, an autophagy enhancer, mitigated diastolic dysfunction, while chloroquine had the opposite effects in type 2 diabetic hearts. Autophagy in the heart is enhanced in type 1 diabetes, but is suppressed in type 2 diabetes. This difference provides important insight into the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is essential for the development of new treatment strategies.",

Type II DM (T2DM) accounts for approximately 90% of all DM cases. Current medicines used in the treatment of DM have some adverse or undesirable effects on patients, necessitating the use of alternative medications. To overcome the low bioavailability of plant metabolites, all entities were first screened through pharmacokinetic, network pharmacology, and molecular docking predictions. Experiments were further conducted on a combination of antidiabetic phytoactive molecules (rosmarinic acid, RA; luteolin, Lut; resveratrol, RS), along with <i>in vitro</i> evaluation (α-amylase inhibition assay) and diabetic mice tests (oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT; oral starch tolerance test, OSTT) for maximal responses to validate starch digestion and glucose absorption while facilitating insulin sensitivity. The results revealed that the combination of metabolites achieved all required criteria, including ADMET, drug likeness, and Lipinski rule. To determine the mechanisms underlying diabetic hyperglycemia and T2DM treatments, network pharmacology was used for regulatory network, PPI network, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses. Furthermore, the combined metabolites showed adequate <i>in silico</i> predictions (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase for improving starch digestion; SGLT-2, AMPK, glucokinase, aldose reductase, acetylcholinesterase, and acetylcholine M2 receptor for mediating glucose absorption; GLP-1R, DPP-IV, and PPAR-γ for regulating insulin sensitivity), <i>in vitro</i> α-amylase inhibition, and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy (OSTT versus acarbose; OGTT versus metformin and insulin) as nutraceuticals against T2DM. The results demonstrate that the combination of RA, Lut, and RS could be exploited for multitarget therapy as prospective antihyperglycemic phytopharmaceuticals that hinder starch digestion and glucose absorption while facilitating insulin sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress are common complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to determine whether resveratrol, a widely used nutritional supplement, can improve insulin sensitivity, metabolic complication as well as hepatic oxidative stress in fructose-fed rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats (180-200 g) were divided into four groups with 8 animals each. Fructose-fed insulin resistant group (Dia) animals were fed 65% fructose (Research diet, USA) for a period of 8 weeks, whereas control group (Con) animals were fed 65% cornstarch (Research Diet, USA). Resveratrol, 10 mg/kg/day (Dia+Resv) or metformin 300 mg/kg/day (Dia+Met) were administered orally to the 65% fructose-fed rats for 8 weeks. At the end of the feeding schedule, Dia group had insulin resistance along with increased blood glucose, triglyceride, uric acid and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Significant (p<0.05) increase in hepatic TBARS and conjugated dienes, and significant (p<0.05) decrease in hepatic SOD and vitamin C was observed in Dia group compared to Con group. Administration of metformin or resveratrol significantly (p<0.05) normalized all the altered metabolic parameters. However, a marked insulin sensitizing action was only observed in the Dia+Resv group. Similarly, while metformin administration failed to normalize the increased TBARS levels and decreased SOD activity, resveratrol showed a more promising effect of all oxidative stress parameters measured in the present study. Attenuation of hepatic oxidative stress in fructose-fed rat liver after resveratrol administration was associated with significant (p<0.05) increase in nuclear level of NRF2 compared with other groups. The present study demonstrates that resveratrol is more effective than metformin in improving insulin sensitivity, and attenuating metabolic syndrome and hepatic oxidative stress in fructose-fed rats.",

      "abstract": "Obesity-associated podocyte injury increases in parallel with inflammatory responses. Resveratrol, as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agent, has been proven to be effective in obesity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the function of resveratrol in the early stages of podocyte injury in ovariectomized rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The 3-month-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham operation with a standard diet; sham operation with a HFD; ovariectomy with a HFD (O+H); and ovariectomy plus HFD treatment with resveratrol (40 mg/kg/day) (O+H+R). Following 12 weeks, the weights of the rats were measured and serum was obtained to measure the levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), serum lipids, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin. Periodic acid-schiff staining was used to detect renal pathological changes. Meanwhile, the expression of the podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and Wilms' tumor-1 was investigated using immunohistochemical staining, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in renal tissues were determined using western blotting. Compared with the O+H group, resveratrol significantly reduced the body weight, serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, FBG and insulin resistance, and increased the levels of E2 in obese rats with an ovariectomy combined with an HFD (P<0.05). Compared with the O+H group, although the O+H+R group had no significant changes in renal pathology, the changes in the levels of podocyte-associated proteins and inflammatory markers were significantly reversed (P<0.05). These results suggest that resveratrol may attenuate early podocyte injury by improving lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and subsequently inhibiting inflammatory responses in obese rats induced by an ovariectomy with a HFD.",

Resveratrol, a natural compound with anti-inflammatory properties, is shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese mice and humans. Here, we tested the effect of a 2-year resveratrol administration on proinflammatory profile and insulin resistance caused by a high-fat, high-sugar (HFS) diet in white adipose tissue (WAT) from rhesus monkeys. Resveratrol supplementation (80 and 480 mg/day for the first and second year, respectively) decreased adipocyte size, increased sirtuin 1 expression, decreased NF-κB activation, and improved insulin sensitivity in visceral, but not subcutaneous, WAT from HFS-fed animals. These effects were reproduced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured in media supplemented with serum from monkeys fed HFS ± resveratrol diets. In conclusion, chronic administration of resveratrol exerts beneficial metabolic and inflammatory adaptations in visceral WAT from diet-induced obese monkeys.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) has been proposed as an energy restriction mimetic. This study aimed to compare the effects of RSV and energy restriction on insulin resistance induced by an obesogenic diet. Any additive effect of both treatments was also analyzed. Rats were fed a high-fat high-sucrose diet for 6 weeks. They were then distributed in four experimental groups which were either fed a standard control diet (C), or treated with RSV (30 mg/kg/d), or submitted to energy restriction (R, 15%), or treated with RSV and submitted to energy restriction (RR). A glucose tolerance test was performed, and serum glucose, insulin, fructosamine, adiponectin, and leptin concentrations determined. Muscle triacylglycerol content and protein expression of insulin receptor (IRβ), protein kinase B (Akt), Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) were measured. In RSV rats, fructosamine concentrations were reduced, HOMA-IR remained unchanged, but glucose tolerance was improved, without changes in phosphorylation of IRβ, Akt, and AS160 or in GLUT-4 protein expression. Rats under energy restriction showed an improvement in all the markers related to glycemic control, as well as increased phosphorylation of AS160 and protein expression of GLUT-4. In rats from RR group the results were similar to R group, with the exception of IRβ and Akt phosphorylation, which were increased. In conclusion, mild energy restriction is more efficient than intake of RSV within a standard balanced diet, and acts by means of a different mechanism from that of RSV. No additive effects between RSV and energy restriction were observed. © 2017 BioFactors, 43(3):371-378, 2017.",

Here, we report combined transcriptomic and metabonomic profiling that showed that the combined supplementation with quercetin and resveratrol produced synergistic effects on a high-fat diet-induced metabolic phenotype in mice. Histological and phenotypic improvements in serum and hepatic total cholesterol, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were also observed in mice receiving combined quercetin and resveratrol supplementation. This combined quercetin and resveratrol supplementation resulted in significant restoration of gene sets in functional pathways of glucose/lipid metabolism, liver function, cardiovascular system, and inflammation/immunity, which were altered by high fat diet feeding. The integration of transcriptomic and metabonomic data indicated quercetin and resveratrol supplementation enhanced processes of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, as well as suppressed gluconeogenesis. These alterations discovered at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels highlight the significance of combined \"omics\" platforms for elucidating mechanistic pathways altered by dietary polyphenols, such as quercetin and resveratrol, in a synergistic manner.",

Insulin-induced ROS generation elevates insulin-regulated metabolic effects; however, chronic oxidative stress causes severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Resveratrol (RV), as a natural antioxidant, eliminates intracellular ROS. It's unclear that whether it has different roles in insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. C57BL/6J mice and C2C12 myotubes were used to assess metabolic regulation effects of RV. Protein activation was detected using Immunofluorescence and Western Blot analysis. ROS were analyzed using confocal microscope and flow cytometry sorting (FACS). Intracellular reducing molecules were detected using an enzymatic method. Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent deoxyglucose analog (2-NBDG). We found that RV attenuated insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation via elimination of insulin-induced ROS generation in skeletal muscle, suggesting that RV decreased activation of the insulin-induced AKT signaling. In skeletal muscle of insulin resistance, RV reduced oxidative stress, restored intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, and enhanced insulin-induced AKT activation and glucose absorption. These results suggested that RV ameliorated insulin resistance by change of redox levels in skeletal muscle. This study revealed bidirectional regulation effects of RV on insulin-stimulated metabolism in skeletal muscle through alternation of intracellular redox homeostasis, which might provide a guidance role for treatment of metabolic diseases.",

Resveratrol (RVS) corrects insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity. We investigated the RVS effects on serum antioxidants, insulin and glucose levels, also visfatin and vaspin genes expression in adipose tissue of streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats (n=32) using STZ (60 mg/kg body weight) and NA (120 mg/kg body weight); rats were divided into 4 groups (n=8). Eight untreated normal rats were used as control group; four diabetic rat groups (2-5) were treated with 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight of RVS, respectively for 30 days. After treatment blood and adipose tissue were prepared from all animals. Serum glucose, insulin, HOMA index, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. Visfatin and vaspin genes expression in adipose tissue were evaluated using real-time PCR. RVS reduced blood glucose significantly and increased insulin level, resulting in insulin sensitivity improvement. Furthermore RVS increased weight and TAC, while reducing serum MDA in the diabetic groups. Visfatin gene expression increased in the diabetic group, and RVS treatment reduced it. Vaspin gene expression was reduced in RVS receiving diabetic groups. The results indicated that RVS has potential hypoglycemic effect, probably by increasing insulin level and changing gene expression of visfatin and vaspin. Moreover RVS showed antioxidant effects through reduction in peroxidiation products and augmented antioxidant capacity.",

We searched the Chinese and English databases (such as CNKI, PubMed, and Embase) and extracted data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Then, RevMan 5.3 was used for bias risk assessment and meta-analysis. The primary outcome indicators include insulin-resistance-related indicators and blood-lipid-related indicators. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018089521). Fifteen RCTs involving 896 patients were included. For insulin-resistance-related indicators, the summary results showed that, compared with the control group, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the resveratrol group is lower (WMD: -0.99; 95% CI -1.61, -0.38; <i>P</i>=0.002). For blood-lipid-related indicators, the total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in the resveratrol group is of no statistical significance (for TC, WMD: -7.11; 95% CI -16.28, 2.06; <i>P</i>=0.13; for TG, WMD: -2.15; 95% CI -5.52, 1.22; <i>P</i>=0.21). For adverse events, the summary results showed that there was no statistical difference in the incidence of adverse events between the resveratrol and control groups (WMD: 2; 95% CI 0.44, 9.03; <i>P</i>=0.37). Based on the current evidence, resveratrol may improve insulin resistance, lower fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and improve oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

The objective of this study was to investigate whether RSV improves high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mice by regulating thelncRNANONMMUT008655.2 <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. To this end, animal and cell insulin resistance models were developed. Specifically, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and administered RSV for eight weeks. Additionally, mouse Hepa cells were treated with palmitic acid, transfected with siRNA NONMMUT008655.2, and treated with RSV. Treated mice and cells were then compared to normal controls that were not exposed to RSV. In the animal model, RSV was found to decrease the levels of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the insulin index and area under the curve; while increasing the insulin sensitivity index. Besides, RSV decreased the expression levels of SOCS3, G6PC, and FOXO1 yet increased that of p-Akt and p-FOXO1 in mice. The same results were observed following knockdown of NONMMUT008655.2 in cells. Overall, our results suggest that RSV may improve hepatic insulin resistance and control blood glucose levels by downregulating lncRNA NONMMUT008655.2.",

      "abstract": "Induced oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus (DM) plays a critical role in insulin resistance. Fork head-related transcription factor (FOXO) proteins are important transcriptional factors involved in oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol with hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties. The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of RSV on <i>FOXO</i> gene expression, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, insulin level, and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) rats. Thirty male Wistar rats were used in this study. DM was induced in rats (n=24) using streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide; then, they were divided into 4 groups of 6 rats each. Six untreated normal rats were used as normal control group; diabetic rats in groups 2 to 5 were treated with 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg /kg body weight of RSV, respectively for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, the rats were sacriﬁced, their sera were separated, and adipose tissues were obtained and stored at -80 °C. Serum glucose and SOD activity levels were determined biochemically, and serum insulin level was determined by ELISA method. Gere expression in <i>FOXO1</i> and <i>FOXO3a</i> in adipose tissue was evaluated using real-time PCR. Results indicated that RSV significantly reduced blood glucose level, increased insulin level and improved insulin sensitivity. RSV resulted in an increased serum SOD activity and caused decreased <i>FOXO1</i> and <i>FOXO3a</i> expression in adipose tissue of rats with T2DM. Therefore, by attenuation of <i>FOXO</i> expression in adipose tissue of T2DM rats, RSV showed a hypoglycemic potential and antioxidant properties, and consequently ameliorated insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenolic compound, has been linked to some beneficial effects against cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted a systematic search to conduct a meta-analysis on cardiometabolic risk factors modulated by RES targeting patients with metabolic syndrome (Met-S) and Obese/Healthy (O/H) subjects. The PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) research question was: Does RES among patients with Met-S and O/H subjects reduce the cardiometabolic risk? The first group was affected with MetS, which is defined as a clustering of abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, and hypertension in a single individual. The second group was composed of 'obese/healthy' individuals, i.e. healthy subjects with or without obesity. We performed a literature search of MEDLINE/ PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for randomised, controlled trials (RCT) that estimated the effects of RES on cardiometabolic risk factors. We found 780 articles, of which 63 original articles and reviews were identified. Data from 17 well-conducted RCT studies, comprising 651 subjects, were extracted for analysis. Overall, RES had a significant influence on Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), resulting in a mean difference of -0.520665 (95% CI: -1.12791; -0.01439; <i>p</i> = 0.00113). In Met-S, RES significantly reduced glucose, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol (T-Chol) as detected by the mean difference of -1.069 (95% CI: -2.107, -0.032; <i>p</i> = 0.043), -0.924 (95% CI: -1.804, -0.043; <i>p</i> = 0.040), and -1.246 (95% CI: -2.314, -0.178; <i>p</i> = 0.022), respectively. Despite some heterogeneity in the populations, RES supplementation seems to improve cardiometabolic health, decreasing some risk factors (HOMA-IR, LDL-C, and T-Chol) associated with CVD.",

      "abstract": "The obese insulin-resistant state is characterized by impairments in lipid metabolism. We previously showed that 3-d supplementation of combined epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol (EGCG+RES) increased energy expenditure and improved the capacity to switch from fat toward carbohydrate oxidation with a high-fat mixed meal (HFMM) test in men. The present study aimed to investigate the longer-term effect of EGCG+RES supplementation on metabolic profile, mitochondrial capacity, fat oxidation, lipolysis, and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. In this randomized double-blind study, 38 overweight and obese subjects [18 men; aged 38 ± 2 y; body mass index (kg/m(2)): 29.7 ± 0.5] received either EGCG+RES (282 and 80 mg/d, respectively) or placebo for 12 wk. Before and after the intervention, oxidative capacity and gene expression were assessed in skeletal muscle. Fasting and postprandial (HFMM) lipid metabolism was assessed by using indirect calorimetry, blood sampling, and microdialysis. Tissue-specific insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with [6,6-(2)H2]-glucose infusion. EGCG+RES supplementation did not affect the fasting plasma metabolic profile. Although whole-body fat mass was not affected, visceral adipose tissue mass tended to decrease after the intervention compared with placebo (P-time × treatment = 0.09). EGCG+RES supplementation significantly increased oxidative capacity in permeabilized muscle fibers (P-time × treatment < 0.05, P-EGCG+RES < 0.05). Moreover, EGCG+RES reduced fasting (P-time × treatment = 0.03) and postprandial respiratory quotient (P-time × treatment = 0.01) compared with placebo. Fasting and postprandial fat oxidation was not significantly affected by EGCG+RES (P-EGCG+RES = 0.46 and 0.38, respectively) but declined after placebo (P-placebo = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Energy expenditure was not altered (P-time × treatment = 0.96). Furthermore, EGCG+RES supplementation attenuated the increase in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations during the HFMM test that was observed after placebo (P-time × treatment = 0.04, P-placebo = 0.01). Finally, EGCG+RES had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, suppression of endogenous glucose production, or lipolysis. Twelve weeks of EGCG+RES supplementation increased mitochondrial capacity and stimulated fat oxidation compared with placebo, but this did not translate into increased tissue-specific insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese subjects. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02381145.",

After 8 weeks, RSV suppressed dyslipidemia, lowered fasting glucose and insulin levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation. These effects were associated with hepatic downregulation of SREBP1 and SREBP2, upregulation of PPARα, and acetylation of Nrf2 (activation) and NF-κβ p65 (inhibition). Also, RSV reduced the transcription of miR-34a and increased the nuclear localisation of SIRT1 in the livers, muscles, and adipose tissues of HFD-fed rats. All these effects were prevented by EX-527 and miR-34a agmir. In conclusion, RSV prevents HFD-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis by suppressing miR-34a-induced activation of SIRT1.",

      "abstract": "The protein deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), involved in regulating hepatic insulin sensitivity, shows circadian oscillation and regulates the circadian clock. Recent studies show that circadian misalignment leads to insulin resistance (IR); however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that CLOCK and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1), two core circadian transcription factors, are correlated with hepatic insulin sensitivity. Knockdown of CLOCK or BMAL1 induces hepatic IR, whereas their ectopic expression attenuates hepatic IR. Moreover, circadian change of insulin sensitivity is impaired in Clock mutant, liver-specific Bmal1 knockout (KO) or Sirt1 KO mice, and CLOCK and BMAL1 are required for hepatic circadian expression of SIRT1. Further studies show that CLOCK/BMAL1 binds to the SIRT1 promoter to enhance its expression and regulates hepatic insulin sensitivity by SIRT1. In addition, constant darkness-induced circadian misalignment in mice decreases hepatic BMAL1 and SIRT1 levels and induces IR, which can be dramatically reversed by resveratrol. These findings offer new insights for coordination of the circadian clock and metabolism in hepatocytes by circadian regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity via CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent SIRT1 expression and provide a potential application of resveratrol for combating circadian misalignment-induced metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol possesses several beneficial metabolic effects in rodents, while the effects of resveratrol in humans remain unclear. Therefore, we performed a non-targeted comprehensive metabolomic analysis on blood, urine, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome randomized to either resveratrol or placebo treatment for four months. Changes in steroid hormones across all four matrices were the most pronounced changes observed. Resveratrol treatment reduced sulfated androgen precursors in blood, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue, and increased these metabolites in urine. Furthermore, markers of muscle turnover were increased and lipid metabolism was affected, with increased intracellular glycerol and accumulation of long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated (n3 and n6) free fatty acids in resveratrol-treated men. Finally, urinary derivatives of aromatic amino acids, which mainly reflect the composition of the gut microbiota, were altered upon resveratrol treatment. In conclusion, the non-targeted metabolomics approach applied to four different matrices provided evidence of subtle but robust effects on several metabolic pathways following resveratrol treatment for four months in men with metabolic syndrome-effects that, for the most part, would not have been detected by routine analyses. The affected pathways should be the focus of future clinical trials on resveratrol's effects, and perhaps particularly the areas of steroid metabolism and the gut microbiome.",

The polyphenol resveratrol prevents the development of experimental NAFLD through modulation of cellular pathways involved in calorie restriction. We aimed to test the hypothesis that resveratrol alleviates NAFLD in a randomised, clinical trial. A total of 28 overweight patients with transaminasemia and histological NAFLD were randomised 1:1 to placebo or resveratrol 1.5 g daily for 6 months. Twenty-six participants completed the trial and underwent repeated clinical investigation, blood work, MR spectroscopy; and 19 participants agreed to a repeat liver biopsy. Resveratrol treatment was generally not superior to placebo in improving plasma markers of liver injury (primary outcome: alanine transaminase, p = 0.51). Resveratrol-treated patients showed a 3.8% decrease in liver lipid content (p = 0.03), with no difference between the two treatment arms (p = 0.38) and no improvement of histological features. Resveratrol treatment was not associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity or markers of the metabolic syndrome, except for a transient decrease in systolic BP. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed no major changes in expression profile. Also, we report a serious adverse event in a patient who developed fever and bicytopenia. In this placebo-controlled, high-dose and long-term study, resveratrol treatment had no consistent therapeutic effect in alleviating clinical or histological NAFLD, though there may be a small ameliorating effect on liver function tests and liver fat accumulation.",

Maternal resveratrol administration recovers metabolic activity of offspring brown adipose tissue. Maternal resveratrol promotes beige adipocyte development in offspring white adipose tissue. Maternal resveratrol intervention protects offspring against high-fat diet-induced obesity. Promoting beige/brite adipogenesis and thermogenic activity is considered as a promising therapeutic approach to reduce obesity and metabolic syndrome. Maternal obesity impairs offspring brown adipocyte function and correlates with obesity in offspring. We previously found that dietary resveratrol (RES) induces beige adipocyte formation in adult mice. Here, we evaluated further the effect of resveratrol supplementation of pregnant mice on offspring thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Female C57BL/6 J mice were fed a control diet (CON) or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 0.2% (w/w) RES during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were weaned onto a HFD and maintained on this diet for 11 weeks. The offspring thermogenesis and related regulatory factors in adipose tissue were evaluated. At weaning, HFD offspring had lower thermogenesis in brown and white adipose tissues compared with CON offspring, which was recovered by maternal RES supplementation, along with the appearance of multilocular brown/beige adipocytes and elevated thermogenic gene expression. Adult offspring of RES-treated mothers showed increased energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity when on an obesogenic diet compared with HFD offspring. The elevated metabolic activity was correlated with enhanced brown adipose function and white adipose tissue browning in HFD+RES compared with HFD offspring. In conclusion, RES supplementation of HFD-fed dams during pregnancy and lactation promoted white adipose browning and thermogenesis in offspring at weaning accompanied by persistent beneficial effects in protecting against HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "As a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia, diabetes complications and tissue damage are exacerbated. There is evidence that natural phytochemicals, including resveratrol, a bioactive polyphenol, may be able to reduce oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity. However, resveratrol's limited bioavailability hampers its therapeutic effectiveness. By using liposomes, resveratrol may be better delivered into the body and be more bioavailable. The objective of this study was to assess the cardioprotective potential of liposome-encapsulated resveratrol (LR) in a streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rat model. Adult male Wistar rats were categorized into five groups: control, diabetic, resveratrol-treated (40 mg/kg), liposomal resveratrol (LR)-treated (20 mg/kg) and liposomal resveratrol (LR)-treated (40 mg/kg) for a five-week study period. We compared the effects of LR to those of resveratrol (40 mg/kg) on various parameters, including serum levels of cardiac markers, tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear transcription factor, oxidative stress markers, and apoptotic markers. LR treatment in STZ-diabetic rats resulted in notable physiological improvements, including blood glucose regulation, inflammation reduction, oxidative stress mitigation, and apoptosis inhibition. LR effectively lowered oxidative stress and enhanced cardiovascular function. It also demonstrated a remarkable ability to suppress NF-kB-mediated inflammation by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Additionally, LR restored the antioxidant enzymes, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, thereby effectively counteracting oxidative stress. Notably, LR modulated apoptotic regulators, including caspase, Bcl2, and Bax, suggesting a role in regulating programmed cell death. These biochemical alterations were consistent with improved structural integrity of cardiac tissue as revealed by histological examination. In comparison, resveratrol exhibited lower efficacy at an equivalent dosage. Liposomal resveratrol shows promise in alleviating hyperglycemia-induced cardiac damage in diabetes. Further research is warranted to explore its potential as a therapeutic agent for diabetic cardiovascular complications and possible cardioprotective effects.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on metabolic health in humans. This randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 39 subjects, including 10 overweight men and 9 overweight women (BMI ≥ 25), as well as 10 non-overweight men and 10 non-overweight women (BMI < 25). Subjects received piceatannol (20 mg/day) or placebo capsules for eight weeks in a random order. The primary outcome was the effect of piceatannol on glucose-metabolism, including insulin sensitivity. The secondary outcomes were the effects on other parameters, including blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), endothelial function, lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, mood status, and Sirt1 and phospho-AMP-activated kinase (p-AMPK) expression in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). Supplementation with piceatannol in overweight men reduced serum insulin levels, HOMA-IR, BP and HR. Other groups, including non-overweight men, as well as overweight and non-overweight women, showed no beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, BP and HR. Furthermore, piceatannol is not associated with other data, including body weight (BW), body composition, endothelial function, lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, mood status, and Sirt1/p-AMPK expression in PBMNCs. In conclusion, supplementation with piceatannol can improve metabolic health, including insulin sensitivity, BP and HR, in overweight men.",

The study aimed to determine the effect of R at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight on the DBA/2J and DBCB mice with diet-induced obesity followed by the consumption high-fat high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD). Behavioral reactions (elevated plus maze [EPM]) and muscle tone (the strength of the forepaw grip) were tested, and plasma biochemical and immunological parameters were assessed. In the repeated EPM test, anxiety increased only in DBCB mice during the second trial. In DBCB mice treated with HFCD, the muscle tone decreased with the second trial; however, this effect was not observed in the background of R consumption. R decreased the level of triglycerides, diminished the activities of alanine and asparagine aminotransferases, which were elevated upon HFCD consumption. Ghrelin level increased after R consumption in mice of both genotypes. The leptin to ghrelin ratio was reduced in DBCB mice receiving R. Consumption of R increased IL-3 and IL-10 levels in both DBA/2J and DBCB mice. IL-12p70 level increased in DBCB mice in response to R. R addition to HFCD reduced several symptoms of dyslipidemia in highly sensitive tetrahybrid mice. The results obtained indicate the importance of a personalized (depending on the genotype) approach when any R prescription, among other BAS and dietary factors, are used in diet therapy for patients with low, moderate and high-risk obesity.",

The liver histology was observed. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was performed to assess insulin sensitivity. Fat accumulation was induced in HepG2 cells, and the cells were treated with RSV. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation levels were determined both in the animal study and cell study. Rats fed a high-fat diet developed abdominal obesity, NAFLD, and insulin resistance (IR), which were markedly improved by 10 weeks of RSV administration. RSV treatment prevented triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in HepG2 cells that were incubated with high concentration of glucose and insulin. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that RSV treatment could promote the phosphorylation of AMPK, which in this study, suppressed 2 lipogenesis gene expressions, contributing to the improvement of NAFLD and IR. The results indicated that by reducing TG accumulation and improving IR, RSV could protect the liver from NAFLD. The activation of AMPK was involved in the mechanism. RSV has the therapeutic potential for preventing or treating NAFLD and IR-related metabolic disorders.",

Resveratrol (Resv) has been reported to ameliorate high-fat diet-induced obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. To examine the effect of Resv on IH-induced metabolic dysfunction, male mice were subjected to IH or room air conditions for 8 weeks and treated with either Resv or vehicle (Veh). Fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and leptin were obtained, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index levels were calculated, and insulin sensitivity tests (phosphorylated AKT [also known as protein kinase B]/total AKT) were performed in 2 visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) depots (epididymal [Epi] and mesenteric [Mes]) along with flow cytometry assessments for VWAT macrophages and phenotypes (M1 and M2). IH-Veh and IH-Resv mice showed initial reductions in food intake with later recovery, with resultant lower body weights after 8 weeks but with IH-Resv showing better increases in body weight vs IH-Veh. IH-Veh and IH-Resv mice exhibited lower fasting glucose levels, but only IH-Veh had increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index vs all 3 other groups. Leptin levels were preserved in IH-Veh but were significantly lower in IH-Resv. Reduced VWAT phosphorylated-AKT/AKT responses to insulin emerged in both Mes and Epi in IH-Veh but normalized in IH-Resv. Increases total macrophage counts and in M1 to M2 ratios occurred in IH-Veh Mes and Epi compared all other 3 groups. Thus, Resv ameliorates food intake and weight gain during IH exposures and markedly attenuates VWAT inflammation and insulin resistance, thereby providing a potentially useful adjunctive therapy for metabolic morbidity in the context of sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the early stage of many metabolic syndromes. The intervention of NAFLD can prevent its further development into severe metabolic syndromes. Given the inefficiency and side effects of chemical drugs for treating NAFLD, the hepatic-targeted nanocarriers loaded with bioactive compounds may offer a more effective and acceptable strategy for eliminating NAFLD. Here we developed hepatic-targeted oxidized starch-lysozyme (OSL) nanocarriers to specifically deliver resveratrol (Res) to liver tissue in order to maximize its therapeutic efficiency. The hepatic targeting was achieved using covalently conjugated galactose (Gal), which is recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptors specifically expressed in hepatocytes. In steatotic HepG2 cell model, treatment with hepatic-targeted Gal-OSL/Res nanocarriers enhanced the cellular Res uptake and anti-lipogenesis capabilities, and effectively decreased triglyceride accumulation by modulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent information regulation 2 homolog 1(SIRT1)/fatty acid synthase (FAS)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) signaling pathway. In mice, Gal-OSL increased Res delivery into liver tissues and increased their hepatic effective concentration in liver. Most importantly, Gal-OSL/Res nanocarriers effectively reversed NAFLD and recovered hepatic insulin sensitivity of NAFLD mice to the healthy state. Furthermore, Gal-OSL/Res efficiently ameliorated lipid deposition and insulin resistance by modulating AMPK/SIRT1/FAS/SREBP1c signaling pathway and downregulated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation at serine 307 in liver. These findings suggested that the hepatic-targeted Gal-OSL nanocarriers delivering Res could potentially serve as a safe and promising platform for NAFLD and other liver related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal iron metabolism can cause β-cell dysfunction, and dedifferentiation is the core mechanism of β-cell dysfunction. However, the specific role of abnormal iron metabolism in dedifferentiation remains unclear. Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) is a crucial regulator of iron metabolism and dedifferentiation, and its transcriptional activity is regulated by silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1). We aimed to investigate the effects of iron metabolism on dedifferentiation under the action of SIRT1/FoxO1. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD). In vitro, MIN6 cells were treated with sodium palmitate (SP). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were used to detect fasting blood glucose in mice. Glucagon, ALDH1A3, Pdx1, and MaFA in the pancreatic tissue were detected by immunofluorescence. Protein levels of SIRT1, FoxO1, Ac-FoxO1, TFRC, DMT1, ferritin, Pdx1, MaFA, and ALDH1A3 in pancreatic tissue and cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Fluorescent probe was used to detect ROS and Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Insulin levels in cells were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Subsequently, interventions were performed with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), deferoxamine (DFO), and resveratrol (RSV) to observe the effects of these interventions on iron metabolism and dedifferentiation in MIN6 cells. The results showed that in HFD mice, HOMA-IR was elevated, HOMA-β decreased, glucagon- and ALDH1A3-positive cells increased, and Pdx1- and MaFA-positive cells decreased. In both in vivo and in vitro assays, lipotoxicity resulted in increased expression of Ac-FoxO1, ALDH1A3, TFRC, DMT1, and ferritin and decreased expression of SIRT1, Pdx1, and MaFA. In MIN6 cells, activation of abnormal iron metabolism by FAC resulted in higher ROS levels, decreased Pdx1 and MafA protein expression, increased ALDH1A3 protein expression, and decreased insulin levels. In contrast, inhibition of abnormal iron metabolism with DFO significantly reduced ROS levels and reversed β-cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, in MIN6 cells, activation of SIRT1 by RSV decreased the expression of Ac-FoxO1, TFRC, DMT1, ferritin, and ALDH1A3; increased Pdx1 and MaFA expression; reduced ROS levels; and elevated insulin levels. SIRT1 inhibits aberrant iron metabolism by inhibiting FoxO1 acetylation levels, reduces ROS levels, and reverses dedifferentiation.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common form of chronic liver disease, can progress to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and advanced fibrosis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is beneficial in treating multiple metabolic diseases. Gnetin C, a resveratrol derivative obtained from Melinjo seed extract (MSE), shares similar health-promoting properties. We investigated the role of gnetin C in preventing NAFLD in a mouse model and compared it with resveratrol. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (10% calories from fat), a high-fat choline-deficient (HFCD) diet (46% calories from fat) and HFCD diet supplemented with gnetin C (150 mg/kg BW·day<sup>-1</sup>) or resveratrol (150 mg/kg BW·day<sup>-1</sup>) for 12 weeks. Gnetin C supplementation reduced body and liver weight, and improved blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. Both gnetin C- and resveratrol reduced hepatic steatosis, with gnetin C also decreasing liver lipid content. Gnetin C and resveratrol ameliorated HFCD diet-induced hepatic fibrosis. The mRNA expression results, and western blot analyses showed that gnetin C and, to some extent, resveratrol downregulated fibrosis markers in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, indicating a possible safeguarding mechanism against NAFLD. These results suggest that gnetin C supplementation may protect against lipid deposition and hepatic fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol with putative anti-obesity effects; however, its mechanisms of action remain unclear due to its low bioavailability. Microbial functions in the physiology result from the microbiota-host coevolution has profoundly affected host metabolism. Here, we sought to determine how beneficial microbiome caused by RSV interventions affects antiobesity. C57BL/6J mice were fed either standard diet (SD) or RSV (300 mg/kg/day) diet for 16 weeks. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Then, transplant the RSV-microbiota to high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (HFD-RSVT) to explore the function of microbiota. Body weight and food intake were monitored. Markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation, gut microbiota compostion, and intestinal barrier were determined. Mice treated with RSV shows a remarkable alteration in microbiota composition compared with that of SD-fed mice and is characterized by an enrichment of Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Parabacteroides, and Ruminiclostridium_9, collectively referred to as RSV-microbiota. We further explored whether RSV-microbiota has anti-obesity functions. Transplantation of the RSV-microbiota to high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (HFD-RSVT) was sufficient to decrease their weight gain and increase their insulin sensitivity. Moreover, RSV-microbiota was able to modulate lipid metabolism, stimulate the development of beige adipocytes in WAT, reduce inflammation and improve intestinal barrier function. Our study demonstrates that RSV-induced microbiota plays a key role in controlling obesity development and brings new insights to a potential therapy based on host-microbe interactions.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (<i>trans</i>-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene, RSV), a naturally occurring biologically active polyphenol has been observed to induce numerous beneficial effects in diabetic animals and humans. However, its protective effects are somewhat controversial due to low bioavailability and rapid clearance rate. Therefore, we in this study have tried to investigate if its main metabolites, RSV-3-<i>O</i>-glucuronide (R3G) and RSV-4-<i>O</i>-glucuronide (R4G) could ameliorate insulin resistance, similar to RSV in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Herein, we first established an insulin-resistant cell model by treating HepG2 cells with 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> insulin for 24 h. Subsequently, the effects of R3G and R4G on insulin resistance inhibition were evaluated in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, our data indicated that R3G and R4G treatment improved cellular glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis contents, and blocked generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, R3G and R4G also modulated insulin signaling and improved insulin sensitivity by modulating the IRS-1/AMPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our data provided a significant new insight into the effects and molecular mechanism of R3G and R4G on ameliorating insulin resistance in HepG2 cells. Overall, our data supported the hypothesis that despite low bioavailability <i>in vivo</i>, RSV biological effects could be mediated through its metabolites.",

Adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups of seven rats each. Diabetes was induced with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). Rats with blood glucose levels above 250 mg/dl after 48 h of streptozotocin injection were included in the diabetic group. Gliclazide and resveratrol were administered for 3 weeks at 5 mg/kg per day and losartan was administered for 3 weeks at 30 mg/kg per day in an oral aqueous suspension. At the end of the third week all rats were euthanized and fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and the metabolic activity of the hepatic enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase were measured in tail blood and liver specimens. All parameters were quantified using an ELISA plate reader. Resveratrol and gliclazide significantly reduced both blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels in diabetic rats (p < 0.001). However, losartan did not exhibit the same effects (p < 0.05). The enzymatic activity of the liver enzymes hexokinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6 phosphatase were enhanced by resveratrol and gliclazide, while losartan treatment was not associated with significant changes in liver carbohydrate metabolism. Resveratrol was not effective in improving liver carbohydrate metabolism relative to gliclazide, a drug widely used to treat diabetes. Dose-response profile of resveratrol remains indeterminate and additional studies may be necessary to determine effective dosing in diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Circadian misalignment induces insulin resistance in both human and animal models, and skeletal muscle is the largest organ response to insulin. However, how circadian clock regulates muscle insulin sensitivity and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here we show circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein (BMAL)-1, two core circadian transcription factors, are down-regulated in insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle. Furthermore, insulin signaling is attenuated in the skeletal muscle of Clock(Δ19/Δ19) mice, and knockdown of CLOCK or BMAL1 by small interfering RNAs induces insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. Consistently, ectopic expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 improves insulin sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an important regulator of insulin sensitivity, in C2C12 myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle, and two E-box elements in Sirt1 promoter are responsible for its CLOCK- and BMAL1-dependent transcription in muscle cells. Further studies show that CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate muscle insulin sensitivity through SIRT1. In addition, we find that BMAL1 and SIRT1 are decreased in the muscle of mice maintained in constant darkness, and resveratrol supplementation activates SIRT1 and improves insulin sensitivity. All these data demonstrate that CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate muscle insulin sensitivity via SIRT1, and activation of SIRT1 might be a potential valuable strategy to attenuate muscle insulin resistance related to circadian misalignment.",

      "abstract": "We have shown that both insulin and resveratrol (RSV) decrease neointimal hyperplasia in chow-fed rodents via mechanisms that are in part overlapping and involve the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). However, this vasculoprotective effect of insulin is abolished in high-fat-fed insulin-resistant rats. Since RSV, in addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, can activate eNOS via pathways that are independent of insulin signaling, such as the activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), we speculated that unlike insulin, the vasculoprotective effect of RSV would be retained in high-fat-fed rats. We found that high-fat feeding decreased insulin sensitivity and increased neointimal area and that RSV improved insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05) and decreased neointimal area in high-fat-fed rats (p < 0.05). We investigated the role of SIRT1 in the effect of RSV using two genetic mouse models. We found that RSV decreased neointimal area in high-fat-fed wild-type mice (p < 0.05), an effect that was retained in mice with catalytically inactive SIRT1 (p < 0.05) and in heterozygous SIRT1-null mice. In contrast, the effect of RSV was abolished in AMKPα2-null mice. Thus, RSV decreased neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury in both high-fat-fed rats and mice, an effect likely not mediated by SIRT1 but by AMPKα2.",

One of the important incretins in the improvement of diabetes is glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), which is secreted by the gut and reduces the apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells and improves insulin sensitivity. In this experiment we determined the effects of resveratrol and probiotics on insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and GLP-1 in type 2 diabetes (T2D) rats. In this study, 40 male Wistar male rats were divided into 5 groups: 1. Control group, 2. T2D, 3. T2D treated with probiotics, 4. T2D treated with resveratrol, 5. T2D group treated with probiotics and resveratrol. After four weeks, the intestine were removed for histopathological analysis, biochemical tests, and oxidative stress markers. Probiotics and resveratrol significantly decreased (p < 0.001) glucose and insulin resistance, and increased (p < 0.001) GLP1 and total antioxidant capacity compared to the diabetic group. Treatment with probiotics and resveratrol also returned intestinal histological changes in diabetic rats to normal. Resveratrol and probiotics appear to be effective in controlling T2D by increasing GLP-1 levels and reducing oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and its comorbidity insulin resistance is a major public health problem in developed countries and those with the disorder have up to a fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease relative to those without the disease. The cardiovascular complications are believed to be due largely to multiple mechanisms relating to hyperglycemia that defines the disease. Overweight and obesity are the predominant risk factors and lifestyle changes aimed at reducing weight and increasing physical activity are the basis for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The role of diet in type 2 diabetes has been investigated widely, but the results have been inconclusive. Recently two large meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies found that dairy product consumption was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Numerous observational studies including large prospective studies found that a high intake of dairy fat or markers of dairy fat were inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. These observations suggest that dairy fat could contain components with anti-diabetogenic properties. Candidates for the antidiabetic affect are rumenic and vaccenic acids, phytanic and pristanic acids vitamin A and β-carotene and butyric acid. The role of these compounds in glucose homeostasis and energy balance is discussed. A common feature is that all are agonists for one or more of the three PPAR isoforms that are expressed in metabolically active tissue, such as the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue where they play a critical role in regulating energy balance and the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose, the main energy sources. Because PPARs have a larger ligand binding pocket than other nuclear receptors they can be activated by a wide range of agonists. Whereas individual components may not be present in sufficient concentration to produce a physiological effect such an effect may be obtained by several components acting in concert, and forms the basis of the hypothesis. PPAR agonists such as anthocyanidins and resveratrol present in nondairy items may also contribute to outcome. In addition, PPAR-α, -β and -γ are abundant in brown adipose tissue where agonists and cold exposure induce uncoupling protein-1 expression in the mitochondria where it acts to generate heat at the expense of storing energy. Animal studies demonstrated that most milk fat bioactive compounds induced uncoupling protein-1 expression in brown adipose tissue, which was associated with suppression of diet-induced obesity and improvement in insulin sensitivity.",

Resveratrol and enalapril have been studied for their beneficial physiological properties on the glucose and lipid metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the oral administration of resveratrol and enalapril effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, evaluating the white pad lipogenesis genes expression in mice. Swiss male mice were divided into four groups and treated for eight weeks as follows: Standard diet ad libitum (G1); Standard diet + Resveratrol (G2); Standard diet + Enalapril (G3); Standard diet + Resveratrol + Enalapril (G4), where resveratrol was administered with the food and enalapril with the water. Body weight, lipid profile, adiposity, glycemic parameters and epididymal adipocytes area were assessed. The expression levels of FAS, ACC, PPARγ and SREBP-1c were assessed by RT-PCR. The main findings showed an improvement in the insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in the group G2 as compared to G1. Similar results were found for the fasting glucose levels. Decreased triglycerides were observed in the animals treated with resveratrol and enalapril, along with decreased weight of the epididymal adipose tissue in the animals of the G2 group. A mild reduction in the group G4 as compared to the group G1 was observed. Decreased mRNA expression of FAS, ACC and PPARγ in the G4 group when compared to the G1 group were observed. In conclusion the resveratrol and enalapril association improved the glucose and lipid profiles by modulating the expression of some lipogenesis genes, which are critical regulators of metabolic homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Obesity manifests as excessive fat storage within adipose tissue (AT) and is often accompanied by insulin resistance, which can initiate the development of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Herein, a dual-targeting drug delivery system is designed to regulate these metabolic disorders by alleviating aberrant fat accumulation and anti-inflammation. Specifically, polymetformin (P) and resveratrol (R), two therapeutic agents that show preferable antiadiposity effect, are co-loaded in macrophage-disguised and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-decorated liposome (aML/R&P). Mechanistically, P and R can upregulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression to promote AT browning and enhance hepatocyte autophagy to ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Meanwhile, the dual modification of macrophage membrane and apoA-I largely improves its targeting efficiency toward liver and AT. In mouse models of obesity and MASLD, aML/R&P effectively reduces body weight, restores metabolic homeostasis, enhances liver parameters, and improves insulin sensitivity, demonstrating great promise in treating obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural ingredient used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV is not clear. In the present study the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV was investigated using mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). C57BL/6J mice were divided into the following three groups: Control (CON), HFD, and HFD + RSV (RSV, 100 mg/kg body weight/day). Mice were administered RSV for 6 weeks; then biochemical and histological parameters, as well as gene and protein expression were detected. Compared with the CON group, the circulating levels of blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and area under the glucose curve were increased (P<0.05), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index was decreased (P<0.05), and lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle was increased in the HFD group. RSV treatment was able to reverse this process and promote the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Moreover, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) expression was upregulated, while the expression levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase were downregulated in the HFD + RSV group compared with the HFD group (P<0.05). Cell experiments inhibiting DDIT4 or activating mTOR also confirmed the role of these pathways. In summary, RSV ameliorated IR and glucose as well as lipid metabolism, and promoted the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway through the DDIT4/mTOR signaling pathway in mice with HFD-induced IR.",

      "abstract": "Dietary bioactive compounds have been demonstrated to produce several health benefits. Genistein, an isoflavone of soy protein, and resveratrol, a polyphenol from grapes, have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and to stimulate white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, leading to increased energy expenditure. However, it has not been demonstrated in humans whether genistein or resveratrol have the capacity to stimulate the differentiation of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from white fat into beige adipocytes. With this aim, we assessed whether stromal vascular fraction cells obtained from biopsies of the subdermal fat depots of subjects with normal body weight (NW) or from subjects with overweight/obesity with (OIR) or without (OIS) insulin resistance were able to differentiate into the beige adipose tissue lineage in vitro, by exposing the cells to genistein, resveratrol, or the combination of both. The results showed that SVF cells obtained from NW or OIS subjects were able to differentiate into beige adipocytes according to an increased expression of beige biomarkers including UCP1, PDRM-16, PGC1α, CIDEA, and SHOX2 upon exposure to genistein. However, SVF cells from OIR subjects were unable to differentiate into beige adipocytes with any of the inducers. Exposure to resveratrol or the combination of resveratrol/genistein did not significantly stimulate the expression of browning markers in any of the groups studied. We found that the non-responsiveness of the SVF from subjects with obesity and insulin resistance to any of the inducers was associated with an increase in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. Consumption of genistein may stimulate WAT browning mainly in NW or OIS subjects. Thus, obesity associated with insulin resistance may be considered as a condition that prevents some beneficial effects of some dietary bioactive compounds.",

The secretion is mediated via unconventional mechanism(s), and in a variety of species, metabolic dysfunction is correlated with elevated circulating FABP4 levels. In diabetic animals, neutralizing antibodies targeting serum FABP4 increase insulin sensitivity and attenuate hepatic glucose output, suggesting the functional importance of circulating FABP4. Using animal and cell-based models, we show that FABP4 is secreted from white, but not brown, adipose tissue in response to lipolytic stimulation in a sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)-dependent manner via a mechanism that requires some, but not all, autophagic components. Silencing of early autophagic genes such as <i>Ulk1/2</i>, <i>Fip200</i>, or <i>Beclin-1</i> or chemical inhibition of ULK1/2 or VPS34 attenuated secretion, while <i>Atg5</i> knockdown potentiated FABP4 release. Genetic knockout of <i>Sirt1</i> diminished secretion, and serum FABP4 levels were undetectable in <i>Sirt1</i> knockout mice. In addition, blocking SIRT1 by EX527 attenuated secretion while activating SIRT1 by resveratrol-potentiated secretion. These studies suggest that FABP4 secretion from adipocytes is regulated by SIRT1 and requires early autophagic components.",

Male C57Bl/6 mice were administered a high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks. Mice developed type 2 diabetes with increased body weight, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia. Oral gavage with RSV significantly reversed the symptoms induced by the HFD. Insulin sensitivity likewise improved after the RSV intervention in these mice. Phenylephrine-induced cremaster arteriolar constriction was impaired, whereas RSV treatment significantly mitigated the vessel responsiveness to phenylephrine. The obese diabetic mice exhibited increased leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and transmigration in the postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle. By contrast, RSV treatment significantly attenuated HFD-induced extravasation. RSV significantly recovered phosphorylated Akt and eNOS expression in the thoracic aorta. In addition, activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in the thoracic aorta was involved in the improvement of epithelial function after RSV intervention. RSV considerably upregulated the plasma NO level in HFD mice. Moreover, RSV-enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cells healing through Sirt1/ER pathway may be involved in the prevention of leukocyte extravasation. Collectively, RSV attenuates diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction by activating Akt/eNOS/NO and Sirt1/ER pathway. Our mechanistic study provides a potential RSV-based therapeutic strategy against cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Patients with diabetes have increased risk of periodontal disease, with increased risk of weakening of periodontal ligament and tooth loss. Periodontal ligament is produced and maintained by periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs). We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction of PDLFs in hyperglycemia produces an accumulation of the reactive glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), leading to increased formation of the major advanced glycation endproduct, MG-H1 and PDLF dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess if there is dicarbonyl stress and functional impairment of human PDLFs in primary culture in high glucose concentration-a model of hyperglycemia, to characterize the metabolic drivers of it and explore remedial intervention by the glyoxalase 1 inducer dietary supplement, <i>trans-</i>resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP). Human PDLFs were incubated in low and high glucose concentration in vitro. Metabolic and enzymatic markers of MG and glucose control were quantified and related changes in the cytoplasmic proteome and cell function-binding to collagen-I, assessed. Reversal of PDLF dysfunction by tRES-HESP was explored. In high glucose concentration cultures, there was a ca. twofold increase in cellular MG, cellular protein MG-H1 content and decreased attachment of PDLFs to collagen-I. This was driven by increased hexokinase-2 linked glucose metabolism and related increased MG formation. Proteomics analysis revealed increased abundance of chaperonins, heat shock proteins (HSPs), Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport and ubiquitin E3 ligases involved in misfolded protein degradation in high glucose concentration, consistent with activation of the unfolded protein response by increased misfolded MG-modified proteins. PDLF dysfunction was corrected by tRES-HESP. Increased hexokinase-2 linked glucose metabolism produces dicarbonyl stress, increased MG-modified protein, activation of the unfolded protein response and functional impairment of PDLFs in high glucose concentration. tRES-HESP resolves this at source by correcting increased glucose metabolism and may be of benefit in prevention of diabetic periodontal disease.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are rapidly expanding public health problems. Acting through the PI3K/Akt pathway, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) inactivate FoxO transcription factors, a class of highly conserved proteins important in numerous physiological functions. However, even as FoxO is a downstream target of insulin, FoxO factors also control upstream signaling elements governing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Here, we report that sustained activation of either FoxO1 or FoxO3 in cardiac myocytes increases basal levels of Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity. FoxO-activated Akt directly interacts with and phosphorylates FoxO, providing feedback inhibition. We reported previously that FoxO factors attenuate cardiomyocyte calcineurin (PP2B) activity. We now show that calcineurin forms a complex with Akt and inhibition of calcineurin enhances Akt phosphorylation. In addition, FoxO activity suppresses protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and disrupts Akt-PP2A and Akt-calcineurin interactions. Repression of Akt-PP2A/B interactions and phosphatase activities contributes, at least in part, to FoxO-dependent increases in Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity. Resveratrol, an activator of Sirt1, increases the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 and triggers Akt phosphorylation in heart. Importantly, FoxO-mediated increases in Akt activity diminish insulin signaling, as manifested by reduced Akt phosphorylation, reduced membrane translocation of Glut4, and decreased insulin-triggered glucose uptake. Also, inactivation of the gene coding for FoxO3 enhances insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that changes in FoxO activity have a dose-responsive repressive effect on insulin signaling in cardiomyocytes through inhibition of protein phosphatases, which leads to altered Akt activation, reduced insulin sensitivity, and impaired glucose metabolism.",

Dysfunction of WAT cells is associated with obesity-associated disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenolic compound, mimics beneficial effects of calorie restriction. As such, RSV seems a promising therapeutic target for obesity-associated disorders. The effect of RSV on the human adipokine profile is still elusive. Therefore, a proteomic study together with bioinformatical analysis was performed to investigate the effect of RSV on the secretion profile of mature human SGBS adipocytes. RSV incubation resulted in elevated basal glycerol release and reduced intracellular TG content. This increased intracellular lipolysis was accompanied by profound changes in the adipocyte secretion profile. Extracellular matrix proteins were down-regulated while processing proteins were mostly up-regulated after RSV treatment. Interestingly, RSV induced secretion of proteins protective against cellular stress and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found a RSV-induced up-regulation of adiponectin and ApoE accompanied by a down-regulation of PAI-1 and PEDF secretion which may improve anti-inflammatory processes and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects may contribute to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic complications. In addition, two novel RSV-regulated adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified.",

We examined the role of SIRT1 in the regulation of uterine receptivity using Ishikawa and RL95-2 endometrial carcinoma cell lines. Exogenous expression of SIRT1 significantly enhanced E-cadherin expression, while small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of endogenous SIRT1 resulted in a significant reduction of E-cadherin expression. A SIRT1 activator resveratrol elevated E-cadherin expression in a dose dependent manner, while SIRT1 repressors nicotinamide and sirtinol exhibited a dose dependent reduction of E-cadherin expression. We also showed that both forced expression of SIRT1 and activation of SIRT1 promote E-cadherin-driven reporter gene constructs, and SIRT1 is localized at E-cadherin promoter containing E-box elements in Ishikawa cells. Using an in vitro model of embryo implantation, we demonstrate that exogenous expression of SIRT1 and stimulation of SIRT1 activity resulted in the Ishikawa cell line becoming receptive to JAR cell spheroid attachment. Furthermore, resveratrol enhanced E-cadherin and Glycodelin protein expression at sites of intercellular contact, suggesting an additive role of resveratrol in promoting implantation. The initial step of human reproduction depends on the capacity of an embryo to attach and implant into the endometrial wall, and these results revealed the novel mechanism that activation and increased expression of SIRT1 play an important role in uterine receptivity.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol has been reported to be beneficial against diabetes complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of resveratrol in decreasing hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) by a preliminary investigation designed as an exploratory clinical trial. Thirteen patients with T1D from both the sexes participated in this trial. All patients received resveratrol in 500 mg capsules, twice daily for 60 days. Bodyweight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model of assessment for β-cell function (HOMA-β), and markers of liver and kidney damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress were measured before the intervention, at 30 days and at 60 days. Resveratrol supplementation for 60 days significantly decreased FBS and HbA1c in comparison with the baseline values. Resveratrol treatment also resulted in a decrease in the level of a marker for oxidative stress, malondialdehyde, and an increase in total antioxidant capacity in T1D patients. Insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and markers of liver and kidney function and inflammation were not significantly affected by resveratrol treatment. Overall, the results showed that 60 days of resveratrol supplementation exerted strong antidiabetic and antioxidant effects in patients with T1D.",

      "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays a major role in glucose homeostasis. Dietary antioxidants such as resveratrol (RSV) may offer some protection against the early stage of diabetes mellitus and the development of complications. The present study investigated the effects of RSV on biochemical parameters and resistin and apelin gene expressions in adipose tissue of rats with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes was induced using a single dose of streptozotocin + nicotinamide. Three groups of diabetic rats were treated with different doses of RSV (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight per day). Oxidative status, serum biochemical parameters, insulin, and HOMA index were measured. Finally, resistin and apelin gene expressions were determined in rats' adipose tissue using RT- PCR (qRT-PCR). A significant reduction in serum glucose level was observed in rats treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg per day RSV compared with the diabetic control. Resistin expression in adipose tissue was reduced in RSV-treated groups, while no significant changes were observed in apelin expression. The results showed that RSV improves insulin sensitivity due to a simultaneous decrease in blood glucose and an increase in insulin. We concluded that RSV has potential hypoglycemic effect, probably by increasing insulin levels and changing the expression of resistin.",

Recently, conflicting results were reported regarding the treatment of NAM in type 2 diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to determine whether and how long-term treatment with NAM at lower dose would affect insulin sensitivity in mice fed chow diet. We treated mice with NAM (100 mg/kg/day) and normal chow for 8 weeks. Strikingly, NAM induced glucose intolerance and skeletal muscle lipid accumulation in nonobese mice. NAM impaired mitochondrial respiration capacity and energy production in skeletal muscle, in combination with increased expression of the mediators for mitophagy (p62, PINK1, PARK2 and NIX) and autophagy (FOXO3, Bnip3, CTSL, Beclin1 and LC-3b). Next, we treated mice with high-fat diet (HFD) and resveratrol (RSV; 100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. RSV protected against HFD-induced insulin resistance and obesity. HFD increased skeletal muscle lipid content as well as NAM, but this increase was attenuated by RSV. In contrast to NAM, HFD enhanced fatty acid oxidative capacity. Muscle transcript levels of genes for mitophagy and autophagy were largely suppressed by HFD, whereas RSV did not rescue these effects. These differences suggest that skeletal muscle autophagy may represent adaptive response to NAM-induced lipotoxicity, whereas reduced autophagy in skeletal muscle may promote HFD-induced lipotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that chronic NAM supplementation in healthy individuals, although at lower dose than previously reported, is still detrimental to glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle lipid metabolism.",

But evidence that Sirtuin gain of function results in increased metabolic efficiency in mammals is limited. We generated transgenic mice with moderate overexpression of SirT1, designed to mimic the Sirtuin gain of function that improves metabolism in C. elegans. These mice exhibit normal insulin sensitivity but decreased food intake and locomotor activity, resulting in decreased energy expenditure. However, in various models of insulin resistance and diabetes, SirT1 transgenics display improved glucose tolerance due to decreased hepatic glucose production and increased adiponectin levels, without changes in body weight or composition. We conclude that SirT1 gain of function primes the organism for metabolic adaptation to insulin resistance, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and decreasing whole-body energy requirements. These findings have important implications for Sirtuin-based therapies in humans.",

      "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is characterized by splicing abnormalities caused by CUG expansion of the DMPK gene transcript. Splicing of exon 11 of the insulin receptor (IR) gene is deregulated to suppress exon 11 inclusion into mRNA in DM1. Consequently, the exon 11-deleted IR isoform that is less sensitive to insulin is predominantly produced, leading to glucose intolerance in DM1. Upregulation of exon 11 retaining full-length IR mRNA is a potential way to recover insulin sensitivity in DM1. We examined candidate chemicals for their ability to enhance inclusion of exon 11 of the IR gene in cultured cells by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of a fragment extending from exons 10 to 12 of IR mRNA. We revealed that resveratrol (RES) enhanced the percentage of exon 11-containing IR mRNA among the total IR mRNA in HeLa cells. The RES-mediated enhancement of exon 11 inclusion was cell-specific and highest in fibroblasts. We tested RES on four fibroblast samples from three generations of one DM1 family. In each sample, RES treatment significantly upregulated the percentage of exon 11-containing IR mRNA to levels higher than that of the control, irrespective of the length of the sample's CTG repeat expansion. A natural compound, RES, was shown for the first time to upregulate the full-length IR mRNA in fibroblasts from DM1 cases. Our results provide the justification of RES as a leading compound to improve glucose tolerance in DM1.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decades, the number of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased globally. One of the major complications in these patients is cardiovascular disease; it seems that the cell proliferation inhibition can improve vascular function in these patients. It is proposed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) can induce cell cycle arrest via cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) activation. Also, it has been shown that phosphorylated tumour suppressor protein p53 is involved in cell senescence by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) upregulation. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol and appears to improve the vascular function through the mentioned pathways. We will aim to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on mRNA expression of PPARα, p53, p21 and p16 in patients with T2D. We will also measure serum levels of cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) as the indicators of cardiovascular status. Seventy-two subjects suffering from T2D will participate in this double-blind randomised parallel placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg/day trans-resveratrol or placebo (methyl cellulose) for 8 weeks. The mRNA expression levels of PPARα, p53, p21 and p16 genes will be assessed using real-time PCR and serum CD163 and TWEAK levels will be measured using commercially available ELISA kits at baseline and the end of the study. Clinical outcome parameters (glycaemic and lipid profiles and body composition) will also be measured before and after study duration. The study is performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences (no: ir.ssu.sph.rec.1396.120). The results will be published in scientific journals. IRCT20171118037528N1; Pre-results.",

In this double-blind clinical trial study, 43 patients with diabetes with chronic periodontitis were participated. Subjects were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention and control groups received either 480 mg/day of resveratrol or placebo capsules (two pills) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), TGs, and pocket depth were measured in all subjects' pre-intervention and post-intervention. The mean serum levels of fasting insulin and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control group (10.42 ± 0.28 and 10.92 ± 0.9; 3.66 ± 0.97 and 4.49 ± 1.56, respectively). There was a significant difference in the mean pocket depth between intervention and control groups (2.35 ± 0.6 and 3.38 ± 0.5, respectively) following intervention. No significant differences were observed in the mean levels of fasting blood glucose and TGs between two groups' post-intervention. It is recommended that resveratrol supplementation may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy along with non-surgical periodontal treatment in insulin resistance and improving periodontal status among patients with diabetes with periodontal disease.

Resveratrol is a naturally occurring compound with potential to reverse NAFL and its associated insulin resistance in adults. The use of resveratrol to reduce risk for T2D through its effect on NAFL has not been examined to date in youth. This paper provides a literature review and protocol for a 30 day proof of principle trial of resveratrol in a population of adolescents at risk for T2D. This randomized double-blind controlled trial is designed with the primary objective of evaluating a twice daily supplementation of 75 mg of resveratrol for safety and tolerability in overweight and obese adolescent subjects (13 to <18 years of age) with NAFL. Secondary objectives are to determine the effect size of the intervention on hepatic steatosis and whole body insulin sensitivity. Adolescents in the intervention arm (n = 10) will receive oral supplementation of resveratrol 75 mg twice daily (with breakfast and dinner) for a total daily dose of 150 mg for the duration of 30 days. The comparison group (n = 10) will receive a placebo twice daily for 30 days. Both cases and controls will receive a standardized lifestyle intervention program. Subjects in both groups will be followed for an additional 30 days post intervention for total study duration of approximately 60 days. Primary outcome measures include a primary side effect profile determined by participant interview, a side effect profile determined by serum biochemistry and vital signs. Secondary outcome measures include an oral glucose tolerance test, liver and cardiac fat content measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, anthropometric measures of overweight/obesity, inflammatory markers, and cardiac function and morphology measured with ultrasonography. Additional outcome measures include serum concentrations of resveratrol, compliance to protocol, physical activity, and nutritional assessment. This study will determine the safety and tolerability of resveratrol in an overweight adolescent population and inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial.",

The beneficial effects of resveratrol on metabolic disorders have been shown previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with NAFLD. In this randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, fifty NAFLD patients were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol capsule or a placebo capsule for 12 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow an energy-balanced diet and physical activity recommendations. resveratrol supplementation reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic steatosis significantly more than placebo (P0·05). There were no significant changes in blood pressure, insulin resistance markers and TAG in either group (P>0·05). Our data have shown that 12-week supplementation of 500 mg resveratrol does not have any beneficial effect on anthropometric measurements, insulin resistance markers, lipid profile and blood pressure; however, it reduced ALT and hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD.",

Recent evidence has indicated that dietary polyphenols may modulate mitochondrial function, substrate metabolism and energy expenditure in humans. The present study investigated the effects of short-term supplementation of two combinations of polyphenols on energy expenditure (EE) and substrate metabolism in overweight subjects. Eighteen healthy overweight volunteers (9 women, 9 men; age 35±2.5 years; body mass index 28.9±0.4 kg m(-2)) participated in a randomized, double-blind cross-over trial. Combinations of epigallocatechin-gallate (E, 282 mg day(-1))+resveratrol (R, 200 mg day(-1)) and E+R+80 mg day(-1) soy isoflavones (S) or placebo capsules (PLA) were supplemented twice daily for a period of 3 days. On day 3, circulating metabolite concentrations, EE and substrate oxidation (using indirect calorimetry) were measured during fasting and postprandial conditions for 6 h (high-fat-mixed meal (2.6 MJ, 61.2 E% fat)). Short-term supplementation of E+R increased resting EE (E+R vs PLA: 5.45±0.24 vs 5.23±0.25 kJ min(-1), P=0.039), whereas both E+R (699±18 kJ 120 min(-1) vs 676±20 kJ 120 min(-1), P=0.028) and E+R+S (704±18 kJ 120 min(-1) vs 676±20 kJ 120 min(-1), P=0.014) increased 2-4 h-postprandial EE compared with PLA. Metabolic flexibility, calculated as the postprandial increase to the highest respiratory quotient achieved, tended to be improved by E+R compared with PLA and E+R+S only in men (E+R vs PLA: 0.11±0.02 vs 0.06±0.02, P=0.059; E+R+S: 0.03±0.02, P=0.009). E+R+S significantly increased fasting plasma free fatty acid (P=0.064) and glycerol (P=0.021) concentrations compared with PLA. We demonstrated for the first time that combined E+R supplementation for 3 days significantly increased fasting and postprandial EE, which was accompanied by improved metabolic flexibility in men but not in women. Addition of soy isoflavones partially reversed these effects possibly due to their higher lipolytic potential. The present findings may imply that long-term supplementation of these dosages of epigallocatechin-gallate combined with resveratrol may improve metabolic health and body weight regulation.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of its action remains largely unknown due to its multiple biological targets and low bioavailability. In this study, we demonstrate that RSV supplementation ameliorates high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, enhancing the abundance of anti-obesity bacterial strains such as <i>Akkermansia, Bacteroides</i> and <i>Blautia</i>. The critical role of gut microbiota in RSV-mediated anti-obesity effects was confirmed through antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which showed that RSV treatment effectively mitigates body weight, histopathological damage, glucose dysregulation and systematic inflammation associated with HFD. Metabolomics analysis revealed that RSV supplementation significantly increases the levels of the gut microbial flavonoid catabolite 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA). Notably, 4-HPA was sufficient to reverse obesity and glucose intolerance in HFD-fed mice. Mechanistically,4-HPA treatment markedly regulates SIRT1 signaling pathways and induces the expression of beige fat and thermogenesis-specific markers in white adipose tissue (WAT). These beneficial effects of 4-HPA are partially abolished by EX527, a known SIRT1 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings indicate that RSV improve obesity through a gut microbiota-derived 4-HPA-SIRT1 axis, highlighting gut microbiota metabolites as a promising target for obesity prevention.",

At 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo, NR significantly improved 6-min walk (+7.0 vs. -10.6 meters, between group difference: +17.6 (90% CI: + 1.8,+∞). Among participants who took at least 75% of study pills, compared to placebo, NR improved 6-min walk by 31.0 meters and NR + resveratrol improved 6-min walk by 26.9 meters.

      "abstract": "Resveratrol has been extensively studied for its multifaceted health benefits. Nonetheless, the pharmacological mechanisms of resveratrol for heart failure remain elusive, especially the cardioprotective effects. To address this knowledge gap, we performed high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and discovered that resveratrol significantly alleviated heart failure, including rescuing abnormalities in heart rate, blood flow, cardiac output, and nppb overexpression. Mechanically, calcium optical mapping revealed that resveratrol diminished the prolongation of calcium duration at 90 % repolarization (CaD90). Membrane potential assay demonstrated that resveratrol alleviated mitochondrial damage, subsequently relieved the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tunel staining further showed that resveratrol inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis both in zebrafish and human AC16 cell. Given the close relationship between the Forkhead Box O (foxo) family and oxidative stress and apoptosis, we used qPCR and noted that resveratrol could regulate the heart failure-induced expressions of foxo1b and foxo3a to normal levels. Furthermore, we conducted in situ hybridization to confirm the effective down-regulation patterns of foxo3a after resveratrol treatment. To investigate whether resveratrol's effects are mediated via foxo3a, we used gardenoside to inhibit foxo3a expression, noting that resveratrol's cardioprotective effects were reduced with foxo3a inhibition. Overall, our study underscores the molecular mechanisms by which resveratrol confers cardioprotection and provides a reference for heart failure therapeutic approaches.",

However, whether pharmacological SIRT1 activators can protect retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells against oxidative and inflammatory injuries related to age-related macular degeneration remains to be explored. Two small molecule specific SIRT1 activators (SRT2104 and CAY10602) were tested, with resveratrol being used as a positive control. Mouse models with sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration were constructed. ARPE-19 cells in culture were used for in vitro experiments. The effects of SIRT1 activators on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARPE-19 cell injury were determined by reactive oxygen species quantification, western blotting, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. In vivo, the severity of retinal damage was assessed using flash electroretinography and histopathological analysis. In vitro, SRT2104, CAY10602 and resveratrol significantly attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death, nucleolar stress response, and reactive oxygen species accumulation. In H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated cells, SIRT1 activators reduced the level of NLRP3, inhibited the activation of caspase-1, and decreased the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The inhibitory effects of SIRT1 activators on caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production were blunted by SIRT1 gene silencing. In vivo, treatment with SRT2104 or CAY10602 in mice with sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration markedly improved the retinal functions and reduced the loss of RPE cells. Our study suggests that small molecule SIRT1 activators are effective for protection of RPE cells against oxidative stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, highlighting potential applications in the treatment of macular degeneration associated RPE dysfunctions.",

Resveratrol was suggested to be able to prevent obesity-related disorders by mimicking caloric restriction; however, its structure-activity relationships and molecular targets are still unknown. We aimed to compare the effects of resveratrol and its analogues on adipocyte metabolism and lipid accumulation in vitro. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes in the absence or presence of resveratrol or its derivatives (oxyresveratrol, monomethylated resveratrol, or trimethylated resveratrol). Intracellular lipid content was assessed by Oil Red O staining. Glucose uptake and its response to insulin were estimated by 2-NBDG, and mitochondrial activity was assayed via resazurin reduction. Involvement of potential molecular pathways was investigated by concurrent treatment with their inhibitors. Although lipid accumulation was significantly reduced by all analogues without altering protein content, oxyresveratrol was the most potent (IC50 = 4.2 μM), while the lowest potency was observed with trimethylated resveratrol (IC50 = 27.4 μM). Increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was restored by each analogue with comparable efficiency. The enhanced mitochondrial activity was normalized by resveratrol and its methylated derivatives, while oxyresveratrol had a minor impact on it. Among the examined pathways, inhibition of SIRT1, PGC-1α, and JNK diminished the lipid-reducing effect of the compounds. Autophagy appeared to play a key role in the effect of all compounds but oxyresveratrol. Resveratrol and its analogues can mimic caloric restriction with complex mechanisms, including activation of SIRT1, PGC-1α, and JNK, making them possible drug candidates to treat obesity-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Fertility preservation is a critical concern for reproductive-age cancer survivors, as conventional cytotoxic therapies can cause irreversible damage to the reproductive system, potentially depriving them of the ability to have children in the future. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1), have become a standard therapeutic approach for various malignancies. However, the impact of ICIs on reproductive function and fertility is not well understood and remains a largely unexplored domain. Resveratrol (RSV), a plant-derived compound, has shown potential as an nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) agonist to counteract reproductive toxicity induced by various diseases, drugs, and environmental toxins. Male C57BL6/J mice with B16 melanoma were assigned into four groups. RSV and ICI/RSV groups received RSV (40 mg/kg) orally every other day for one month, while controls received the vehicle. ICI and ICI/RSV groups were injected with anti-PD-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) weekly, and controls received IgG2b kappa antibody. Parameters like body and testicular weight, sperm concentration, and western blot for ferroptosis markers were measured. Furthermore, oxidative stress biomarkers, lipid oxidation factors, and gonadal hormone levels were quantified using commercial kits. Anti-PD-1 therapy caused male reproductive dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced sperm concentration, altered gonadal hormone levels, and disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity. Furthermore, ferroptosis was a key mechanism in anti-PD-1-induced testicular dysfunction, characterized by disrupted iron homeostasis, elevated lipid peroxidation, and suppression of the system Xc-/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis. Additionally, anti-PD-1 therapy diminished antioxidant defenses by inhibiting the NRF2 pathway, thereby increasing the susceptibility to ferroptosis. Crucially, RSV treatment ameliorated anti-PD-1-induced reproductive dysfunction. This was achieved by reducing T cell infiltration, lowering interferon-gamma levels, activating the NRF2 pathway, and maintaining iron and lipid homeostasis. Our study demonstrates that anti-PD-1 triggers oxidative stress and ferroptosis in the testis, causing male reproductive dysfunction. RSV may offer protection against testicular toxicity associated with anti-PD-1, particularly through its antioxidant and anti-ferroptosis properties.",

      "abstract": "Perimenopause constitutes a pivotal transitional phase characterized by hormonal variability and heightens vulnerability to depressive episodes. This study seeks to elucidate the mechanism of resveratrol (RES) in perimenopausal depression through integrated network pharmacology, molecular docking analysis, and experimental validation. Screening yielded 83 RES-related disease targets, with IL10, CCL2, and SERPINE1 identified as core genes overexpressed in perimenopausal depression. GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis predicted that the target genes could regulate the PI3K-Akt, FoxO, HIF-1, and IL-17 signaling pathways. Molecular docking indicated SERPINE1 as a promising RES target. Consistently, in vitro experiments showed that RES significantly attenuated the inflammatory response and apoptosis of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated CTX-TNA2 cells. RES also reduced the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, SERPINE1 proteins and acetylation, while increasing the expression of BDNF, TrkB, SIRT1, and decreasing MAO-A proteins. In vivo experiments demonstrated that RES also significantly improved the depression behaviors, increased the levels of 5-HT1A and SIRT1, and decreased levels of MAO-A of depression rats. This study unveils RES's potential targets and mechanism in perimenopausal depression, laying groundwork for future research.",

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most commonly occurring ocular diseases worldwide. This degenerative condition affects the retina and leads to the loss of central vision. The current treatments are focused on the late stage of the disease, but recent studies have highlighted the importance and benefits of preventive treatments and how good dietary habits can reduce the risk of progression to an advanced form of the disease. In this context, we studied whether resveratrol (RSV) or a polyphenolic cocktail, red wine extract (RWE), are able to prevent the initiating events of AMD (i.e., oxidative stress and inflammation) in human ARPE-19 retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and macrophages. This study highlights that RWE and RSV can prevent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or 2,2'-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative stress and can subsequently prevent DNA damage via the inhibition of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated)/Chk2 (checkpoint kinase 2) or Chk1 signaling pathways, respectively. Moreover, ELISA assays show that RWE and RSV can prevent the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in RPE cells and in human macrophages. Interestingly, RWE exhibits a greater protective impact compared to RSV alone, even though RSV was more concentrated when used alone than in the red wine extract. Our results suggest that RWE and RSV may have potential interest as preventive nutritional supplementations against AMD.",

      "abstract": "Pyraclostrobin (Pyra) is a fungicide in the strobilurin class and has proven to be very toxic to organisms primarily aquatic species. Resveratrol (Res) is a phytoalexin that exhibits multiple bioactivities as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protective, and anti-aging and is found in plant species such as mulberry, peanut, and grape. This study aimed to determine the protective effect of Res against Pyra-induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in rats. For this purpose, a total of 48 male rats divided into 6 groups - 8 in each group - were exposed to 30 mg/kg Pyra by oral gavage once a day for 30 days and to three different concentrations of Res (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) together with Pyra. Pyra administration increased liver enzyme parameters and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels whereas decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Also, Pyra treatment increased pro-apoptotic (Bax), apoptotic (Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9), pro-inflammatory (NFκB), cancer (CYP2E1), and cell regulatory (p53) gene expressions and decreased anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression in the liver. Furthermore, DNA damage in blood and histopathological changes in the liver and kidney were observed with Pyra administration. In contrast, Res administrations in a dose-dependent manner improved Pyra-induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative and DNA damages, expression levels of these genes in the liver, and histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. Consequently, the treatment of Res, known for its anti-oxidant and protective properties, exhibited a protective effect on Pyra-induced lipid peroxidation, oxidant/anti-oxidant status, gene expressions, and DNA damage in rats.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RES supplementation on oxidative stress in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN). <b>Methods</b>: This randomized, single-center, open-label study involved 72 adult patients, with 40 completing the intervention. Participants in the intervention group received 400 mg of liposomal RES daily for 12 weeks alongside HEN, while the control group received HEN only. Body composition and oxidative stress markers-including total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH)-were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. <b>Results</b>: Significant increases in TAC and SOD activity were observed in both groups. GPx activity increased significantly only in the RES group. MDA levels rose in both groups but were more pronounced in the RES group. GSH levels showed no significant changes. Phase angle (PhA) increased significantly in the RES group, while no significant change was observed in the control group. <b>Conclusions</b>: RES supplementation may enhance antioxidant defenses, as evidenced by increased GPx activity and improvements in TAC and SOD levels, supporting oxidative balance in patients with HNC receiving HEN. The higher MDA levels in the RES group may reflect RES's dual antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities. Additionally, the observed increase in PhA suggests potential cellular health benefits. These findings highlight the potential of RES as a complementary antioxidant intervention in clinical oncology, warranting further investigation to clarify its therapeutic effects on oxidative stress and cellular health in cancer care.",

After SCI, severe secondary injuries can cause intense inflammatory storms and oxidative stress responses, leading to extensive neuronal apoptosis. Effective regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress after SCI remains an unresolved challenge. In this study, resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles coated with neutrophil membranes (NMR) were prepared using the emulsion-solvent evaporation method and membrane encapsulation technology. Multifunctional biomimetic nanoparticles retain neutrophil membrane-related receptors and possess a strong adsorption capacity for inflammatory factors. As a drug carrier, NMR can sustainably release resveratrol for >72 h. Moreover, co-culture studies <i>in vitro</i> show that the NMR help regulate macrophage polarization to relieve inflammatory response, reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species by approximately 50%, and improve mitochondrial membrane potential to alleviate oxidative stress. After injecting NMR into the injury site, it reduces early apoptosis, inhibit scar formation, and promote neural network recovery to improve motor function. This study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects of NMR, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for SCI.",

RSV promotes survival signals in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through activation of SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase. RSV and SIRT1 reduce RGC loss induced by direct optic nerve injury, but effects in indirect models of traumatic optic neuropathy remain unknown and are examined in this study. An electromagnetic stereotaxic impactor device was used to impart five traumatic skull impacts with an inter-concussion interval of 48 hours to wild type (WT) and SIRT1 knock in (KI) C57BL/6J mice overexpressing the SIRT1 gene. A cohort of WT mice also received intranasal administration of RSV (16 mg/kg) throughout the experimental period. Loss of righting reflex (RR), optokinetic response (OKR) scores, and immunolabeled RGC count are determined to assess optic neuropathy in this model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI significantly decreases RGC survival and decreases OKR scores compared with control uninjured mice. Either RSV administration in WT mice, or SIRT1 overexpression in SIRT1 KI mice, significantly increases RGC survival and improves OKR scores. RR time increases after the first few impacts in all groups of mice subjected to TBI, demonstrating that RSV and SIRT1 overexpression are able to attenuate optic neuropathy following similar degrees of TBI. Intranasal RSV is effective in preserving visual function in WT mice following TBI. Constitutive overexpression of SIRT1 recapitulates the neuroprotective effect of RSV. Results support future exploration of RSV as a potential therapy for indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.",

This study aimed to elucidate the impact of RES on PSD. A PSD rat model was established through middle cerebral artery occlusion and chronic unpredictable mild stress. Rats received RES via gavage, and depressive behaviors were evaluated through various measures. Cerebral infarction areas and brain tissue pathology were assessed using TTC and H&E staining. Levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6/IL-10), neurotransmitters (ACH/DA/5-HT/BDNF), and oxidative stress-related indicators (SOD/GSH-Px/MDA), along with the total Nrf2/C-Nrf2/N-Nrf2/HO-1 proteins, were analyzed. The role of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway was investigated by co-treating rats with RES and either an Nrf2 pathway specific inhibitor (ML385) or activator (dimethyl fumarate). PSD rats exhibited depressive behaviors, disrupted neurotransmitter levels, and oxidative stress markers. RES treatment effectively alleviated these symptoms and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in PSD rat brain tissues. Co-administration of ML385 attenuated the beneficial effects of RES in PSD rats. Altogether, RES mitigates depressive behaviors, improves cognitive dysfunction, and reduces oxidative stress and inflammatory response in PSD rats. These effects are mediated through the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suggesting RES as a potential therapeutic agent for PSD-related cognitive impairment.",

We examine the impact of experimental SAH modeled through endovascular perforation, and the effectiveness of subsequent treatment on FC, through three key questions: 1) Does the endovascular perforation model of SAH induce deficits in FC; 2) Does exposure to hypoxic conditioning provide protection against these FC deficits and, if so, is this neurovascular protection SIRT1-mediated; and 3) does treatment with the SIRT1 activator resveratrol alone provide protection against these FC deficits? Cranial windows were adhered on skull-intact mice that were then subjected to either sham or SAH surgery and either left untreated or treated with hypoxic post-conditioning (with or without EX527) or resveratrol for 3 days. Mice were imaged 3 days post-SAH/sham surgery, temporally aligned with the onset of major SAH sequela in mice. Here we show that the endovascular perforation model of SAH induces global and network-specific deficits in FC by day 3, corresponding with the time frame of DCI in mice. Hypoxic conditioning provides SIRT1-mediated protection against these network-specific FC deficits post-SAH, as does treatment with resveratrol. Conditioning-based strategies provide multifaceted neurovascular protection in experimental SAH.",

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/L of PEN from 4 to 96 h post fertilization (hpf) and cardiac developmental toxicity was assessed. Our results showed that PEN decreased hatching rate, survival rate, heart rate and body length, with increased malformation rate and spontaneous movement. PEN induced pericardial edema and abnormal cardiac structure in myl7:egfp transgenic zebrafish, as well as downregulation of cardiac development related genes (nkx2.5, tbx2.5, gata4, noto, and vmhc). In addition, PEN elevated oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and triggered cardiomyocytic apoptosis by upregulation of p53, bcl-2, bax and caspase 3. These adverse outcomes were counteracted by RES, indicating that RES ameliorated PEN-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis in zebrafish. Taken together, this study revealed the important role of oxidative stress in PEN-induced cardiotoxicity and identified dietary RES supplementation as a novel strategy to mitigate its toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Hydrocephalus is one of the most common neurological disorders, but pharmacotherapy options are currently lacking due to the complex pathogenesis. The blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB), consisting of choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells, is a crucial gate for the entry of peripheral immune cells and its dysfunction emerges as an important contributor to hydrocephalus pathology. Meanwhile, SPAK-mediated CSF hypersecretion in ChP epithelial cells plays an important role in hydrocephalus. Here, we fabricated a transferrin receptor-targeted nano-drug (siR/RSV@TNP) that can intelligently navigate to the blood-CSF barrier and prepared for combined delivery of resveratrol (RSV) and SPAK siRNA (siSPAK) for synergetic hydrocephalus therapy. As expected, siR/RSV@TNP fulfilled its function of knocking down SPAK expression, relieving inflammation and oxidative stress, retrieving blood-CSF barrier integrity, and ultimately preventing ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus in male mice. Here, we demonstrate that targeting the choroid plexus blood-CSF barrier and cerebrospinal fluid hypersecretion offers a promising approach for alleviating hydrocephalus.",

Iron scavengers or ferroptosis inhibitors could reduce infarct volume and improve neurological function in mice. Resveratrol has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects. However, it is unclear whether resveratrol can play a neuroprotective role via inhibiting ferroptosis. Our study showed that resveratrol pretreatment had a similar effect with ferrostatin‑1, which inhibited neuronal ferroptosis-related changes, such as iron overload, damages of oxidation-reduction system, and destruction of mitochondrial structure, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and application of ferroptosis inducers. In addition, middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury in vivo also induced ferroptosis, and resveratrol pretreatment could inhibit ferroptosis and reduce degenerative neurons, cerebral ischemic damage and infarction volume. Our results are the first to indicate that resveratrol pretreatment might inhibit ferroptosis induced by OGD/R and ferroptosis inducers in neurons, and MCAO/R in rats.",

In addition, <i>Trichinella</i> infection poses an infinite and major challenge to the host's immune system. Resistance and side effects limit the efficiency of the existing anti-<i>trichinella</i> medication. Given that concern, this work aimed to investigate the anti-helminthic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of resveratrol and zinc during both phases of <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> infection. Sixty-four Swiss albino mice were divided into four equal groups: non-infected control, infected control, infected and treated with resveratrol, and infected and treated with zinc. Animals were sacrificed on the 7th and 35th days post-infection for intestinal and muscular phase assessments. Drug efficacy was assessed by biochemical, parasitological, histopathological, immunological, and immunohistochemical assays. Resveratrol and zinc can be promising antiparasitic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agents, as evidenced by the significant decrease in parasite burden, the significant improvement of liver and kidney function parameters, the increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) level, the increase in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like-2 factor expression, and the improvement in histopathological findings. Moreover, both drugs enhanced the immune system and restored the disturbed immune balance by increasing the interleukin 12 (IL-12) level. In conclusion, resveratrol and zinc provide protection for the host against oxidative harm and the detrimental effects produced by the host's defense response during <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> infection, making them promising natural alternatives for the treatment of trichinellosis.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of dietary resveratrol (RES) and β-Hydroxy-β-methyl butyric acid (HMB) on immune, oxidative, and morphological changes in the livers of Tibetan sheep using transcriptomics and metabolomics. One hundred and twenty male Tibetan lambs of a similar initial weight (15.5 ± 0.14 kg) were randomly divided into four groups with thirty lambs per treatment: (1) H group (basal diet without RES or HMB); (2) H-RES group (1.5 g/day of RES); (3) H-HMB group (1250 mg/day of HMB); (4) H-RES-HMB group (1.5 g/day of RES and 1250 mg/day of HMB). The experiment was conducted for 100 days, including a pre-test period of 10 days and a formal period of 90 days. The results showed significantly increased concentrations of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and IgM in the H-RES-HMB group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while the malondialdehyde levels were significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The glycolytic indices including creatinine kinase (CK), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were significantly increased in the H-RES-HMB group compared with the others (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A histological analysis showed that the hepatic plate tissue in the H-RES-HMB group appeared normal with multiple cells. The transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression of genes associated with the calcium signaling pathway (<i>MYLK2</i>, <i>CYSLTR2</i>, <i>ADCY1</i>, <i>HRH1</i>, <i>ATP2B2</i>, <i>NOS2</i>, <i>HRC</i>, <i>ITPR1</i>, and <i>CAMK2B</i>) and the NF-κB signaling pathway (<i>BCL2</i> and <i>CARD14</i>) in the H-RES-HMB group were upregulated. The key differential metabolites (d-pyroglutamic acid, DL-serine, DL-threonine, fumarate, and glyceric acid) were enriched in the pathways associated with D-amino acid metabolism, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and carbon metabolism. The combined transcriptomic and non-targeted metabolomic analyses showed the co-enrichment of differential genes (<i>NOS2</i> and <i>GLUD1</i>) and metabolites (fumarate) in arginine biosynthesis-regulated glycolytic activity, whereas the differential genes (<i>ME1</i>, <i>SCD5</i>, <i>FABP2</i>, <i>RXRG</i>, and <i>CPT1B</i>) and metabolites (Leukotriene b4) co-enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway affected the immune response by regulating the PI3K/AKT and cGMP/PKG signaling. In conclusion, the dietary RES and HMB affected the hepatic antioxidant capacity, immune response, and glycolytic activity through modulating the transcriptome (<i>BCL2</i>, <i>CAMK2B</i>, <i>ITPR1</i>, and <i>IL1R1</i>) and metabolome (DL-serine, DL-threonine, fumaric acid, and glycolic acid).",

Resveratrol, a nonflavonoid phenol, shows well-documented antioxidant properties. We investigated the potential antioxidant ability of this natural compound in a mouse model of alcohol addiction. We administered (per os) for 60 d 10 mg · kg<sup>-1</sup> · d<sup>-1</sup> of resveratrol in alcoholic adult male mice. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring serum-free oxygen radicals defense and free oxygen radical levels. Resveratrol metabolites were measured in the serum of mice that were administered with resveratrol. Finally, the effect of resveratrol on the alcohol-induced alteration of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) in the liver was investigated. Prolonged consumption of resveratrol strongly counteracts serum radical oxygen species formation caused by chronic alcohol intake without effects on natural, free oxygen radical defense. The presence of resveratrol metabolites in the serum only of animals supplemented with resveratrol potentiates the evidence that the antioxidant effect observed is due to the ingestion of the natural compound. Moreover, resveratrol supplementation can counteract alcohol-induced BDNF elevation in the liver, which is the main target of organ alcohol-induced damage. The consumption of resveratrol through metabolite formation may play a protective role by decreasing free radical formation and modulating the BDNF involved in hepatic disruption induced by chronic alcohol consumption. Further investigation into the mechanism underlying the protective effect could reinforce the potential use of resveratrol as a dietary supplement to prevent damage associated with chronic alcohol abuse.",

A control (CON) group was reared at the normal feeding temperature and received a basal diet, and 4 cold exposure (8 ± 1°C for 10 h/d from d 29 to 42) groups were fed the basal diet with 0 (CE), 250 (CE + RES250), 500 (CE + RES500), and 750 (CE + RES750) mg/kg RES from d 22 to 42. Broilers were slaughtered on d 42 and heart tissues were collected to measure the relevant indexes. The results showed that heart tissues of all CE-broilers had inflammatory cell infiltrations, and dietary RES supplementation reduced this phenomenon. Compared to CON group, the concentrations of MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were increased and activities of SOD and CAT were decreased in all CE-broilers (P < 0.05). mRNA expression of genes related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (GRP78, IRE1, PERK, EIF-2α, ATF4, ATF6, and CHOP), pyroptosis (NLRP3, ASC, Caspase1, GSDME, IL-18, and IL-1β), and proinflammation (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-6) was upregulated and that of ant-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) was downregulated in CE and all CE + RES groups compared to CON group (P < 0.05). Compared to CE group, the activities of SOD and CAT and mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory genes were increased (P < 0.05), and concentrations of MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and mRNA expression of ER stress, pyroptosis and proinflammatory genes were reduced (P < 0.05) in 3 CE + RES groups. Additionally, protein levels of PERK, ATF4, CHOP, NLRP3, Caspase1, GSDMD, IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 were similar in their mRNA expression. Overall, cold exposure caused oxidative stress and ER stress, and induced pyroptosis and inflammatory response, resulting in heart injury in broilers, and dietary RES addition reduced heart damage by enhancing antioxidant defense function. This study indicates that RES can be a feed additive to alleviate cold exposure-induced heart injury in broilers, and a 500 mg RES/kg diet is the optimal supplemental level.",

Hyperglycemia-induced inflammation is linked to the onset and progression of diabetes. Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol phytoalexin, is studied in diabetes therapeutics research. This study evaluates the effect of RES on inflammation and glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells exposed to high glucose. Inflammation and glucose metabolism-related genes were investigated using qPCR. Further, inflammatory genes were analyzed by applying ELISA and Bioplex assays. High glucose significantly increases IKK-α, IKB-α, and NF-kB expression compared to controls. Increased NF-kB expression was followed by increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-β, and COX2. RES treatment significantly reduced the expression of NF-kB, IKK-α, and IKB-α, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. High glucose levels reduced the expression of TGFβ1, while treatment with RES increased the expression of TGFβ1. As glucose levels increased, PEPCK expression was reduced, and GCK expression was increased in HepG2 cells treated with RES. Further, HepG2 cells cultured with high glucose showed significant increases in KLF7 and HIF1A but decreased SIRT1. Moreover, RES significantly increased SIRT1 expression and reduced KLF7 and HIF1A expression levels. Our results indicated that RES could attenuate high glucose-induced inflammation and enhance glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells.",

Its final impact on male fertility and reproductive outcomes should be considered since the number of adolescents and young adults presenting diabetes is rising. Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol, is a biological modulator with multitarget and multi-action characteristics. to evaluate if RES is effective against the male reproductive damage caused by type 1 diabetes (DM1), focusing on sperm DNA integrity and reproductive outcome. At 30 dpp (days postpartum), male rats were divided into 7 groups: Sham control (SC); RES vehicle (RV); RES (R); STZ-diabetic (D; induced at 30dpp with 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin); STZ-diabetic + insulin (DI); STZ-diabetic + RES (DR); STZ-diabetic + insulin +RES (DIR). DR, DIR, and R groups received 150mg RES/kg b.w./day by gavage (from 33 to 110dpp). DI and DIR received insulin (from day 5 after DM1 induction until 110dpp). Blood glucose was monitored in different time points. Animals were mated with healthy females. Euthanasia occurred at 110 dpp. DM1 increased lipid peroxidation (testis and epididymis) and sperm DNA fragmentation, alterations of chromatin structure, reduced mitochondrial mass and acrosome integrity, causing a decline in fertility and pregnancy rates. RES improved the parameters. RES, as an adjuvant, activates specific reactions against hyperglycemia, the main trigger of most complications of diabetes, by controlling oxidative stress, probably as a result of SIRT1 activation. We present here more evidences showing its valuable role in diminishing diabetes seriousness to male reproduction, not only to spermatogenesis in the first instance, but also to sperm overall quality and fertility outcomes, regardless of insulin treatment. RES attenuated lipid peroxidation and sperm DNA damage in DM1-induced animals, which positively reflected on male fertility. Our results show RES potential against DM1 complications in male reproduction.",

Cervical carcinoma is treatable in the early stages, while it progresses to metastasis at advanced stages; however, generally, it is poorly manageable with current treatment options. For future advances in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer carcinoma, the identification of new therapeutic platforms is necessary. A new generation of drugs, herbs and spices may provide novel opportunities for cancer therapy. Among the herb-based components, resveratrol has several beneficial effects given its anticancer activities (e.g., anti-angiogenesis, anti-proliferation, anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic). Hence, this therapeutic agent may prove to have promising potential if clinically corroborated to possess anticancer efficacy. Here, we summarize the chemopreventive and treatment actions of resveratrol for cervical cancer as well as its mechanism of action.",

However, the obstruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) seriously impairs the efficacy of resveratrol. Herein, we develop a stepwise targeting nanoplatform for enhanced ischemic stroke therapy, which is fabricated by pH-responsive poly(ethylene glycol)-acetal-polycaprolactone-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-Acetal-PCL-PEG) and modified with cRGD and triphenylphosphine (TPP) on a long PEG chain and a short PEG chain, respectively. The as-designed micelle system features effective BBB penetration through cRGD-mediated transcytosis. Once entering the ischemic brain tissues and endocytosed by microglia, the long PEG shell can be detached from the micelles in the acidic lysosomes, subsequently exposing TPP to target mitochondria. Thus, the micelles can effectively alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation by enhanced delivery of resveratrol to microglia mitochondria, reversing the microglia phenotype through the scavenging of ROS. This work offers a promising strategy to treat ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Twenty-four male mice were allocated into four experimental groups as control, ketamine (20 mg/kg), resveratrol (80 mg/kg) and co-administration of the ketamine (20 mg/kg) + resveratrol (80 mg/kg). Mice were received resveratrol for 30 days and ketamine was used for an animal model of schizophrenia and was injected from days 16 to 30 of the study. After the drug administration was finished, schizophrenia-like behaviors were evaluated using object recognition test, tail suspension test, forced swimming test and open field test and brain malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were determined. According to the results, ketamine treatment significantly decreased body weight and pretreatment with resveratrol elevated body weight compared to ketamine group (P < 0.05). Ketamine treatment significantly decreased number of the cross in open field test and pretreatment with resveratrol improved i (P < 0.05). Immobility time in tail suspension and forced swimming tests increased in mice treated with ketamine (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with resveratrol diminished immobility time compared to ketamine group (P < 0.05). Ketamine significantly decreased memory deficits while pretreatment with resveratrol significantly reduced the memory deficits induced by ketamine (P < 0.05). Brain MDA increased in both cortical and sub-cortical area in ketamine treated mice while pretreatment with resveratrol decreased ketamine-induced elevation in MDA (P < 0.05). Ketamine significantly decreased brain SOD, GPx and CAT levels while pretreatment with resveratrol improved SOD, GPx and CAT levels (P < 0.05). Findings suggested resveratrol has neuroprotective effects against ketamine-induced behavioral deficits and oxidative damages.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis is primarily driven by lipotoxicity-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, yet effective treatments remain challenging to identify. In this work, a novel therapeutic approach was introduced via a ultrasound (US) -driven, reactive oxygen species (ROS) -scavenging and liver-targeted nanobubbles system, termed Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA, which co-encapsulated resveratrol (RSV) and obeticholic acid (OCA). This system provides a safe and efficient platform for specifically delivering these agents to the liver in the context of the NASH therapy. The synthesized nanobubbles showed a spherical morphology with an average diameter of 165 ± 6.05 nm, whose encapsulation efficiencies of approximately 93 % for RSV and 90 % for OCA were achieved. These nanobubbles exhibited the enhanced targeting and accumulation within NASH affected cells and the excellent biocompatibility in cytotoxicity experiments. Subsequently, in vitro assessments using HepG2 cells, Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA improved lipid metabolism and reduced ROS levels. It was also showed in vivo experiments in mice that the hepatic targeting of Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA increased their effective concentration within the liver. In addition, the hepatic-targeting and ultrasound-driving Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA nanocarriers enhanced the cellular uptake of RSV and OCA in a NASH cell model and improved ROS-scavenging capabilities. Meanwhile, these nanocarriers modulated lipid metabolism (triglycerides, total cholesterol), inflammatory cytokine metabolism (IL-4, IL-10, IL-15, TNF-α) and oxidative stress levels (SOD, MDA). Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA activated the FXR/SHP signaling pathway, enhanced FoxO1 activity, and alleviated lipid accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In summary, these findings suggest that Apt-DTP-NBs@RSV@OCA pave a promising way for the treatment of NASH.",

Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol that has several proven biological activities, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Thus, the aim of our study was to verify the possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of RSV on human mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors aged between 40 and 59 and 60-80 years old. For this, 6-8 patients were selected by age group. Cells were isolated and divided into 4 groups: Control (C), RSV only, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (to induce an oxidizing environment - C+) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+RSV. The quantification of reactive nitrogen species (NO and ONOO-), as well as pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10) was performed. Pearson's correlation and comparison between groups were performed (p<0.05). Our results showed a greater role of RSV in the middle-aged compared to the elderly group, in relation to the balance of NO/ONOO- and the levels of cytokines IL-6 and TNFα. It was also possible to observe an improvement in the anti-inflammatory profile in both age groups, but more effective in the cells in the middle-aged group. Thus, we could observe that RSV has better activity in the reduction of important biomarkers of oxidation and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "The glucose requirement of dairy cows is mainly met by increasing the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, due to negative energy balance, the liver of periparturient cows is under oxidative stress induced by lipid over-mobilization, and hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced. Studies have demonstrated that resveratrol, which is widely known for its antioxidant properties, can alter hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, it is not clear whether resveratrol could regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis by its antioxidant properties. This study aims to investigate the precise effect of resveratrol in hepatic gluconeogenesis, the role of resveratrol on hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes and the potential mechanism using primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 5 healthy Holstein calves (1 d old, 30 to 40 kg, fasted) and treated with different concentrations of resveratrol (0, 5, 10, 25, or 50 μM) combined with or without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0, 100, or 200 μM) induction for 12 h. Resveratrol enhanced the expression of gluconeogenic genes of calf hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Conversely, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> suppressed the expression of gluconeogenic genes and induced oxidative stress (P < 0.05), which was improved by resveratrol in calf hepatocytes (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-AKT pathway was found to negatively regulate gluconeogenesis. An AKT inhibitor was used to assess the role of the mTORC2-AKT pathway in the effects of resveratrol. The results showed resveratrol promoted hepatic gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the mTORC2-AKT pathway. Moreover, sestrin 2 (SESN2) upregulated the activity of mTORC2. We further found that resveratrol decreased SESN2 levels (P < 0.001). This study indicated that resveratrol enhances the gluconeogenic capacity of calf hepatocytes by improving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and modulating the activity of the SESN2-mTORC2-AKT pathway, implying that resveratrol may be a promising target for ameliorating liver oxidative stress in transition cows.",

However, RSV has low oral bioavailability. In this study and in order to overcome the issue, RSV was encapsulated into the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). In this study, RSV-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (RSV-SLNs) were prepared by the solvent emulsification-evaporation technique, and their physicochemical properties were optimized using Box-Behnken response surface methodology. The morphology of the particles was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The neuroprotective effects of the nanoparticles were investigated in animal models using the Morris water maze (MWM). Then after, the rats were sacrificed, their brains were collected, and the extent of lipid peroxidase (LPO) as well as the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined in the hippocampus section samples. Finally, the collected brain tissues were histologically studied. The particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE%), and drug loading (DL%) of the optimized nanoparticles were 104.5 ± 12.3 nm, 0.322 ± 0.11, -3.1 ± 0.15 mV, 72.9 ± 5.31% and 14.6 ± 0.53%, respectively. The microscopic images revealed spherically shaped and nonaggregated nanoparticles. The <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrated higher efficiency of RSV-SLN in the reduction of escape latency time and improvement in the time spent in the target quadrant compared to free RSV. Moreover, it was demonstrated that RSV-SLN posed a higher potency in the reduction of LPO as well as elevation of the GSH levels in the brain samples. The histological studies revealed a decline in neural degeneration and an improvement in the CA1 pyramidal cell morphology. The obtained data revealed that RSV-SLNs caused more reduction in Alzheimer-related symptoms rather than free RSV.",

The most evident changes are at the behavioral and cognitive level, with decreased learning capacity, recognition memory, and motor incoordination. The use of exogenous antioxidants has been implemented as a potential pharmacological option to delay the onset of brain aging by attenuating oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Resveratrol (RSVL) is a polyphenol present in various foods, such as red fruits, and drinks, such as red wine. This compound has shown great antioxidant capacity due to its chemical structure. In this study, we evaluated the effect of chronic RSVL treatment on oxidative stress and cell loss in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of 20-month-old rats, as well as its impact on recognition memory and motor behavior. Rats treated with RSVL showed an improvement in locomotor activity and in short- and long-term recognition memory. Likewise, the concentration of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation decreased significantly in the group with RSVL, coupled with an improvement in the activity of the antioxidant system. Finally, with the help of hematoxylin and eosin staining, it was shown that chronic treatment with RSVL prevented cell loss in the brain regions studied. Our results demonstrate the antioxidant and neuroprotective capacity of RSVL when administered chronically. This strengthens the proposal that RSVL could be an important pharmacological option to reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases that affect older adults.",

The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing inflammation in heat-stressed rats.",

Here, we treated <i>mdx</i> mice with various doses of resveratrol (0.04, 0.4, and 4 g/kg food) for 56 weeks and examined the effects on serum creatine kinase levels and physical activities. Because resveratrol promotes autophagy, we also investigated whether autophagy including mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) is involved in resveratrol's effects. Autophagy/mitophagy-related genes and autophagic flux were downregulated in the muscle of <i>mdx</i> mice, and these phenomena were reversed by resveratrol with significant ROS reduction. Resveratrol at 4 g/kg food reduced the number of immature myofibers containing central nuclei and fine fibers < 400 <i>μ</i>m<sup>2</sup> and increased that of thicker myofibers in the quadriceps, suggesting that resveratrol decreased myofiber wasting and promoted muscular maturation. Accordingly, resveratrol at 0.4 g/kg food reduced the creatine kinase levels to one-third of those in untreated <i>mdx</i> mice and significantly increased the animals' physical activities. In C2C12 myoblast cells, resveratrol promoted mitophagy and eliminated mitochondria containing high superoxide levels. The clearance of damaged mitochondria and ROS reduction by resveratrol was completely suppressed by an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) and by knocking down <i>Atg5</i> or <i>Pink1</i>, essential genes for autophagy and mitophagy, respectively. Thus, resveratrol is a potential therapeutic agent for DMD, and the clearance of damaged mitochondria probably contributes to its action.",

In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol, an activator of an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), attenuates age-related sarcopenia and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mice. Treatment of mice with resveratrol (0.4 g/kg diet) from 28 weeks of age for 32 weeks prevented aging-associated shortening of rotarod riding time. In the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, histogram analysis showed that the atrophic muscle was increased in 60-week-old (wo) mice compared with 20-wo mice, which was attenuated by resveratrol. In the heart, resveratrol attenuated an aging-associated increase in the cardiomyocyte diameter. Acetylated proteins were increased and autophagic activity was reduced in the TA muscle of 60-wo mice compared with those of 20-wo mice. Resveratrol treatment reduced levels of acetylated proteins and restored autophagic activity in the TA muscle. Aging-related reduction in myocardial autophagy was also suppressed by resveratrol. Skeletal muscle-specific SIRT1 knockout mice showed increases in acetylated proteins and atrophic muscle fibers and reduced autophagic activity in the TA muscle. These results suggest that activation of SIRT1 by treatment with resveratrol suppresses sarcopenia and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by restoration of autophagy in mice.",

C2C12 myotubes were incubated with resveratrol in the presence of increasing concentrations of glucose, and metabolic and clock proteins were measured for 24 h. Resveratrol led to SIRT1, AMPK and PP2A activation. Myotubes treated with increasing glucose concentrations showed higher activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. However, resveratrol did not activate the mTOR signaling pathway, except for P70S6K and S6. In accordance with the reduced mTOR activity, resveratrol led to advanced circadian rhythms and reduced levels of pBMAL1 and CRY1. Resveratrol increased myogenin expression and advanced its rhythms. In conclusion, resveratrol activates the SIRT1-AMPK-PP2A axis, advances circadian rhythms and induces muscle development.",

Ovaries were extirpated in all groups and subjected to biochemical and histopathological tests. Cisplatin-induced damage to ovarian tissue was graded and scored as the total histopathological findings score. The ovarian function was assessed using immunohistochemical staining for c-kit expression. Rats' malondialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels were determined. The histopathological finding score was significantly higher in Group 2 than in other groups (p<0.05). The superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 2 (p<0.001 for both cases). The malondialdehyde level was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 3 (p<0.001). The study findings demonstrated that resveratrol reduced ovarian injury and enhanced biochemical parameters following cisplatin-induced ovary damage in experimental models.",

Rotenone is a pesticide, used to make animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of our study was to investigate the protective effect of resveratrol on rotenone-induced microglial BV-2 cells and the mechanism. BV-2 cells were pretreated with resveratrol for 1 h and then exposed to rotenone. The level of microglia activation was detected. The Iron content and the production of glutathione, malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species(ROS) were detected to reflect the status of oxidative stress. The mRNA levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by qRT-PCR.The expressions of p-STAT1, NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and SLC7A11 were measured by western blot. Our results showed that resveratrol attenuates microglia activation and M1 polarization in rotenone-induced BV-2 cells. Rotenone induced the production of free iron, ROS and MDA and inhibited the activity of glutathione, while the effects were reserved by resveratrol. Resveratrol also inhibited the induction effect of rotenone on IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. In addition, resveratrol enhanced the protective effect of on rotenone-induced BV-2 cells via the inhibition of STAT1 and Keap1 and the upregulation of Nrf2 and SLC7A11. Resveratrol attenuated rotenone-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in BV-2 cells through enhancing the inhibition of STAT1and Keap1 and the upregulation of Nrf2 and SLC7A11.",

      "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex that plays a crucial role in initiating immune responses to harmful stimuli. However, excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can cause acute and chronic inflammation, leading to the progression of various inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and sepsis. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic compound found in plants with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Among the previously synthesized and purified RSV derivatives, SH-707 was identified as a novel therapeutic candidate for inflammatory diseases due to its ability to target the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of SH-707 on lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. SH-707 significantly decreased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion and pyroptosis in macrophages, which are associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the IL-1β inhibitory effect of SH-707 surpassed that of conventional RSV. SH-707 treatment increased the expression of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and SIRT3 in macrophages. However, SH-707 inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation primarily through the SIRT1 signaling pathway, rather than SIRT3. Furthermore, SH-707 exerted significant therapeutic effects in the lipopolysaccharide-induced septic mouse model by reducing IL-1β and inflammation in lung tissue. Investigating SH-707 and its molecular mechanism offers the potential for novel therapeutic strategies in inflammasome-mediated diseases.",

Seventy-two weaned piglets were divided into the following groups: control group, LPS-challenged group, and LPS-challenged groups pretreated with either RSV or PT for 14 d (n = 6 pens, three pigs per pen). At the end of the feeding trial, piglets were intraperitoneally injected with either LPS or an equivalent amount of sterile saline. After 6 h of sterile saline or LPS injection, plasma and liver samples were collected. LPS stimulation caused massive apoptosis, activated inflammatory responses, and incited severe oxidative stress in the piglet livers while also promoting the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 (P < 0.001) and the protein expression of Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3; P = 0.001) and cleaved caspase 1 (P < 0.001). PT was more effective than RSV in alleviating LPS-induced hepatic damage by decreasing the apoptotic rate of liver cells (P = 0.045), inhibiting the transcriptional expression of interleukin 1 beta (P < 0.001) and interleukin 6 (P = 0.008), and reducing myeloperoxidase activity (P = 0.010). The LPS-induced increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation accumulation was also reversed by PT (P = 0.024). Importantly, inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in a hepatocellular model largely blocked the ability of PT to prevent tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced increases in NF-κB p65 protein phosphorylation (P = 0.043) and its nuclear translocation (P = 0.029). In summary, PT is a promising agent that may alleviate liver injury and immunological stress of weaned piglets via the PP2A/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.",

Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits were equally assigned into four groups: control (saline), CIN (intravenous iopromide; 7.5 g iodine/kg), Res + CIN (per os Res; 5 mg/kg), and Lyc + CIN (per os Lyc; 4 mg/kg). Serum Cr (sCr); symmetric/asymmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA/ADMA); oxidative stress biomarkers: malondialdehyde; total antioxidant capacity; catalase; glutathione) were evaluated in blood samples at three time points: right after (0 h); 24 h; 48 h after iopromide/saline administration. CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were determined (48 h). All animals were sacrificed at 48 h and both kidneys collected. Oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in renal tissue. sCr and SDMA/ADMA levels increased significantly in CIN compared to all groups. Oxidative stress secondary to CIN in blood/kidneys was suppressed by Res/Lyc. B and T lymphocytes decreased significantly in CIN compared to all groups. The present study provides emerging evidence that Res/Lyc ameliorate CIN by modulating oxidant/antioxidant balance in blood/renal tissue and by inhibiting vasoconstriction/blood cytotoxicity.",

On the other hand, DZN increased serum and liver malondialdehyde. DZN significantly increased Forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1) expression and decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt-1) expression. DZN impaired glucose hemostasis. Instead, Res treatment significantly reversed status of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes activities induced by DZN. Also, Res improved glucose hemostasis. Res increased PTEN and Sirt-1 expression and reduced Foxo1 expression. Res administration ameliorated liver histopathological changes induced by DZN. These data confirmed that DZN significantly enhances oxidative stress and impairs glucose hemostasis. While Res showed a protective effect against the toxicity induced by DZN in rats.",

      "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious complication of pregnancy, and the likely pathogenic basis of early onset PE are placental dysfunction and increased oxidative stress. Resveratrol (RES) is a potent antioxidant which has shown beneficial effects in many diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of RES against oxidative stress-induced damage in trophoblasts, and elucidate the potential mechanisms. We established an in vitro model of oxidative stress by exposing the human first-trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The level of oxidative stress was reflected by ROS, MDA and SOD. The viability of cells was determined by the MTS assay. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC staining and flow cytometry. Levels of SIRT1(sirtuin 1) and autophagy-related proteins (LC3, Beclin-1, p62) were detected by western blot. Autophagosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Pre-treatment with RES significantly ameliorated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, morphological damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Mechanistically, RES restored the levels of SIRT1 and autophagy-related proteins including LC3-II, Beclin-1 and p62 that were dysregulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Blocking autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) completely abolished the protective effects of RES, as did knocking down SIRT1. RES may protect human trophoblasts against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress by activating SIRT1-dependent autophagy, and therefore has therapeutic potential in PE.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of doxorubicin exposure on female fertility and how to prevent it have not been well studied yet. Here, mouse oocytes were employed to investigate the issues mentioned above. The results showed that doxorubicin treatment impaired oocyte meiotic maturation by destroying spindle assembly and chromosome arrangement. In addition, doxorubicin caused oxidative stress by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, doxorubicin led to severe DNA damage in oocytes, which eventually induced apoptosis through DNA damage-P63-Caspase3 pathway. Conversely, resveratrol (RES) effectively improved oocyte quality by restoring spindle and chromosome configuration, reducing ROS levels and inhibiting apoptosis. In summary, our results indicate that RES can protect oocytes against doxorubicin-induced damage.",

It affects the nuclear retinoid-X-receptor (RXR), which implies a modulating effect of RXR to gynaecologic cancers. Furthermore, RSV targets Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), a histone deacetylase. 123 tissue samples of patients with serous or mucinous ovarian cancer were examined for expression of Sirt1 and RXR. Ovarian cell lines were treated with RSV and consequences on viability and apoptosis were evaluated. The influence of RSV to Sirt1 and RXR expression was analyzed by western blotting RESULTS: A correlation of nuclear Sirt1 and RXRα expression could be detected (p = 0.006). Co-expression of nuclear RXRα and cytoplasmic (p = 0.026) or nuclear (p = 0.041) Sirt1 was associated with significantly increased overall survival in advanced tumour stages. Viability was decreased in all cell lines after stimulation with resveratrol, while cell apoptosis was increased. RSV treatment led to significant lower Sirt1 expression in A2780 cells (p = 0.025) and significant increased RXR expression in cisA2780 cells (p = 0.012) CONCLUSION: In order to use RSV as medical target, studies could be developed to improve the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and consequently improve treatment outcome.",

      "abstract": "Treating diabetic retinopathy (DR) effectively is challenging, aiming for high efficacy with minimal discomfort. While intravitreal injection is the current standard, it has several disadvantages. Implantable systems offer an alternative, less invasive, with long-lasting effects drug delivery system (DDS). The current study aims to develop a soft, minimally invasive, biodegradable, and bioadhesive material-based hydrogel scaffold to prevent common issues with implants. A grid-shaped scaffold was created using coaxial 3D printing (3DP) to extrude two bioinks in a single filament. The scaffold comprises an inner core of curcumin-loaded liposomes (CUR-LPs) that prepared by microfluidics (MFs) embedded in a hydrogel of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and an outer layer of hyaluronic acid-chitosan matrix with free resveratrol (RSV), delivering two Sirt1 agonists synergistically activating Sirt1 downregulated in DR. Optimized liposomes, prepared via MFs, exhibit suitable properties for retinal delivery in terms of size (<200 nm), polydispersity index (PDI) (<0.3), neutral zeta potential (ZP), encapsulation efficiency (∼97 %), and stability up to 4 weeks. Mechanical studies confirm scaffold elasticity for easy implantation. The release profiles show sustained release of both molecules, with different patterns related to different localization of the molecules. RSV released initially after 30 min with a total release more than 90 % at 336 h. CUR release starts after 24 h with only 4.78 % of CUR released before and gradually released thanks to its internal localization in the scaffold. Liposomes and hydrogels can generate dual drug-loaded 3D structures with sustained release. Microscopic analysis confirms optimal distribution of liposomes within the hydrogel scaffold. The latter resulted compatible in vitro with human retinal microvascular endothelial cells up to 72 h of exposition. The hydrogel scaffold, composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan, shows promise for prolonged treatment and minimally invasive surgery.",

RES-modified polysulfone (PSF) hemodialysis membranes have been fabricated using an immersion phase transformation method. The antioxidant properties of the blend membranes were evaluated in terms of their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS<sup>+</sup>), reactive oxygen species (ROS) free radicals scavenging, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of serum and lipid peroxidation inhibition. The observed results of decreasing DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup> levels, scavenging ROS, significant inhibition of lipid peroxidation and improving the T-AOC of serum all contribute to the recovery of oxidative balance and the use of RES as an antioxidant modifier. The antioxidant stability of PSF/RES blend membranes was also studied. Moreover, the results of blood compatibility experiments showed that the addition of RES improved the blood compatibility of PSF membrane, inhibited the adhesion of red blood cells and platelets; inhibited complement activation; and reduced the blood cells deformation rate. The dialysis simulation experiment indicated that PSF/RES membrane (M-3) can clear 90.33% urea, 89.50% creatinine, 74.60% lysozyme and retention 90.47% BSA. All these results showed the new PSF/RES blend membranes have potential to be used in the field of hemodialysis to improve oxidative stress status in patients.",

      "abstract": "Emergency wounds are often accompanied by bacterial infection, oxidative stress, and excessive inflammation due to the inability to quickly close and stop bleeding, resulting in chronic wounds that are difficult to heal. Clinically, surgical suturing is the fastest method for wound closure, but it is only suitable for wounds with small bleeding volumes and causes unsightly scar formation. Consequently, there is a critical need for hemostatic dressings versatile enough to address a spectrum of diverse and intricate wounds, especially in emergency scenarios. In this study, we constructed a unique versatile natural gelatin-based hydrogel with hemostasis, antibacterial, and anti-inflammation properties. The hydrogel was composed of 4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy) butyrylethylenediamine-modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA-NB) and epigallocatechin gallate-grafted polylysine (EPL-EGCG), which imparts adhesion, antibacterial and antioxidant properties to the hydrogel. Simultaneously, the hydrogel was loaded with GelMA microspheres encapsulating natural resveratrol (RES@GM). This combination not only exhibited outstanding hemostatic capabilities but also preserved the anti-inflammatory potential of RES. In different animal models, the hydrogel exhibited outstanding hemostatic and wound healing effects, down-regulated the expression of IL-1<i>β</i>to promote inflammatory regulation and potential for angiogenesis and anti-scar. In conclusion, unique versatile natural gelatin-based hydrogel suitable for various complex wounds provides a promising strategy for emergency wound dressing applications.",

Antioxidant enzymes and eNOS expressions in vessels were elevated by resveratrol and exercise. Resveratrol and exercise enhanced gene expressions of non-selective PDE1, 2, 3 and cAMP selective PDE4 but not cGMP selective PDE5 in the aorta.

This system is designed for minimally invasive, targeted drug delivery to the retina. Upon administration, the microneedles rapidly dissolve, enabling localized release of the nanoparticles. The RPE membrane coating provides homologous targeting, enhancing cellular uptake while mitigating systemic exposure. In a rabbit model of NaIO<sub>3</sub>-induced dry AMD, this approach demonstrated significant preservation of retinal architecture, including significant mitigation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and retinal degeneration, alongside excellent safety and biocompatibility profiles. This innovative delivery strategy addresses the critical barriers in AMD treatment by offering a safe, efficient, and patient-friendly solution, paving the way for its broader application in posterior eye diseases.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a significant virulence factor of gram-negative bacteria, adversely affects female reproduction, especially the maturation and early embryonic development of oocytes, through inducing of inflammatory and oxidative stress-associated toxic responses. Resveratrol (Res), a potent antioxidant, exhibits many beneficial effects on the maturation and developmental competence of oocytes. However, it is unclear whether Res can restore LPS-induced defects in the maturation of oocytes during meiosis. In this study, we used porcine oocytes to explore the protective effects of Res and its underlying mechanism against the toxic impacts of LPS exposure on meiotic maturation and developmental competence of oocytes during meiosis. The oocytes were randomly assigned to a control, LPS-exposed or Res-supplemented group. Nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation was assessed after 26 h (MI) or 44 h (MII) of in vitro maturation (IVM). Our results showed that 10 µM Res significantly improved the rates of oocyte maturation and blastocyst formation after exposure to 15 µg/mL LPS. In addition, Res preserved the normal spindle/chromosome structure and maintained acetylated tubulin levels, actin polymerization and cortical granules (CGs) distribution. Additionally, Res protected mitochondrial content and function, scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduced DNA damage and apoptosis in LPS-exposed oocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by its specific inhibitor EX527 suppressed the recovery of ROS levels, mitochondrial content, and spindle/chromosome structure by Res supplementation. In summary, this study shows that Res can alleviate the impacts of LPS-induced toxicity on meiosis in porcine oocytes by upregulating SIRT1, which ameliorates oxidative stress and increasing mitochondrial content.",

However, its detailed role in aging has not yet been promulgated. This study aimed to explore the potential anti-aging role of <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> by comparing the anti-aging effect of resveratrol in young and old mice. Measurement of intestinal aging-related factors in colon and serum, and vascular endothelial function-related factors in serum were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gut microbial analysis of intestinal contents were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The effect of <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> on reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) in aged mice were greater than that of resveratrol. While the effect of <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> on nitric oxide (NO) level was less than that of resveratrol, the reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pentosidine (PTD) was better than that of resveratrol in young mice. In young mice, <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> promoted an increase in the beneficial genus <i>Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Ileibacterium</i> less effectively as compared with resveratrol treatment. In aged mice, <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> promoted the increase of <i>Bifidobacterium, Ileibacterium</i> less effectively than resveratrol, and promoted the increase of <i>Akkermansia, Staphylococcus, Verrucomicrobiota</i> expression better as compared with resveratrol treatment. Both young and old mice showed the same results for the remaining markers, including changes in gut microbial composition and predictions of function. <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> has similar anti-aging functions with resveratrol. <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> may even be more effective than resveratrol in reducing oxidative stress, improving vascular endothelial function, and redistributing gut microbiota. The research provides an innovative strategy of <i>Dubosiella newyorkensis</i> to improve aging.",

      "abstract": "Independent supplementation with nitrate (NIT) and resveratrol (RSV) enriches various aspects of mitochondrial biology in key metabolic tissues. Although RSV is known to activate Sirt1 and initiate mitochondrial biogenesis, the metabolic benefits elicited by dietary nitrate appear to be dependent on 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated signaling events, a process also linked to the activation of Sirt1. Although the benefits of individual supplementation with these compounds have been characterized, it is unknown if co-supplementation may produce superior metabolic adaptations. Thus, we aimed to determine if treatment with combined +NIT and +RSV (+RN) could additively alter metabolic adaptations in the presence of a high-fat diet (HFD). Both +RSV and +NIT improved glucose tolerance compared with HFD (<i>P</i> < 0.05); however, this response was attenuated following combined +RN supplementation. Within skeletal muscle, all supplements increased mitochondrial ADP sensitivity compared with HFD (<i>P</i> < 0.05), without altering mitochondrial content. Although +RSV and +NIT decreased hepatic lipid deposition compared with HFD (<i>P</i> < 0.05), this effect was abolished with +RN, which aligned with significant reductions in Sirt1 protein content (<i>P</i> < 0.05) after combined treatment, in the absence of changes to mitochondrial content or function. Within epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), all supplements reduced crown-like structure accumulation compared with HFD (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission (<i>P</i> < 0.05), alongside reduced adipocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), with the greatest effect observed after +RN treatment (<i>P</i> = 0.0001). Although the present data suggest additive changes in adipose tissue metabolism after +RN treatment, concomitant impairments in hepatic lipid homeostasis appear to prevent improvements in whole body glucose homeostasis observed with independent treatment, which may be Sirt1 dependent.",

We investigated both the anti-SASP and anti-inflammatory activities of a nutritional supplement, namely Fenoxidol™, composed of turmeric extract bioCurcumin (bCUR), Polydatin (the natural glycosylated precursor of Resveratrol-RSV), and liposomal β-caryophyllene (BCP), in two human cellular models, such as the primary endothelial cell line, HUVECs and the monocytic cell line, THP-1. Replicative and Doxorubicin-induced senescent HUVECs, both chosen as cellular models of SASP, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated THP-1, selected as a model of the inflammatory response, were treated with the three single natural compounds or with a combination of them (MIX). In both senescent HUVEC models, MIX treatment significantly reduced IL-1β and IL-6 expression levels and p16<sup>ink4a</sup> protein, and also increased SIRT1 protein level, as well as downregulated miR-146a and miR-21 expression, two of the so-called inflamma-miRNAs, more effectively than the single compounds. In THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS, the MIX showed a significant effect in decreasing IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and miR-146a expression levels and Caspase-1 activation, in association with an up-regulation of SIRT1 protein, compared to the single compounds. Overall, our results suggest that the three analysed compounds can have a combined effect in restraining SASP in senescent HUVECs as well as the inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells.",

The novel senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) indicates aging, and it suppresses hepatic oxidative stress. However, the effects of RSV on SMP30 expression regulation remain unclear. We observed that RSV positively regulates SMP30 expression in rat hepatoma-derived FAO cells. However, this was abolished by Compound C and EX-527 that specifically inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Silent Information Regulator T1 (Sirt1), respectively. We predicted binding sites for AMPK, forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1), and Sirt1 downstream molecules as possible SMP30 promoters using the JASPAR and UniProtKB databases. We identified a Foxo1 binding site in the promoter region of SMP30. Inhibiting Foxo1 with AS1842527 also decreased the RSV-induced upregulation of SMP30 expression. Moreover, RSV suppressed the substantial downregulation of SMP30 expression caused by oxidative stress and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and released accumulated lactate dehydrogenase. These results demonstrate that, as a novel food factor, RSV-induced upregulation of SMP30 by activating AMPK/Sirt1-Foxo1 signaling and may attenuates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage. The findings of this study offer new perspectives of the anti-ageing properties of RSV.",

Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, is known to exert several pharmacological effects on lung injury. However, its physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profile limit its clinical applications. In this study, RSV was loaded into lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) aiming to overcome these limitations. RSV-LNCs were prepared by phase inversion method and showed small uniform particle size (∼55 nm, PdI 0.04) with high entrapment efficiency >99%. The efficacy of RSV-LNCs in the prophylaxis against ALI and treatment of CPF was investigated in bleomycin-induced lung injury. For assessment of ALI, rats were administered a single oral dose of RSV (10 mg/kg) either free or as RSV-LNCs 4 h before bleomycin and euthanized 3 days later. For CPF, treatments in the same dose were given daily from days 10-20 after bleomycin and rats were euthanized on day-21. Results showed enhanced beneficial role for RSV-LNCs, compared to RSV, in the prevention of ALI as demonstrated by preservation of pulmonary microscopic and ultrastructural architecture and improvement of pulmonary functions. Analysis of BALF revealed reduction in oxidative stress markers, IL-6 level, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. iNOS and c-caspase 3 immunohistochemical expression and CD68<sup>+</sup> cells immunofluorescence were inhibited. However, RSV-LNCs failed to show any improvement in oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, apoptosis and collagen deposition in CPF. In conclusion, RSV-LNCs are promising nanoplatforms for mitigating ALI detrimental effects. Future research investigating higher doses and longer durations of treatment is recommended to evaluate RSV-LNCs anti-fibrotic potential in CPF.",

Exposure to nicotine, either via active or passive smoking is strongly shown to enhance renal oxidative stress and augment kidney failure in various animal models. In this study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol supplementation on nicotine-induced kidney injury and oxidative stress in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given nicotine (0.6 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in combination with either resveratrol (8 mg/kg, i.p.), or angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, irbesartan (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. Upon completion of treatment, kidneys were investigated for changes in structure, kidney injury markers and oxidative stress. Administration of nicotine alone for 28 days resulted in significant renal impairment as shown by marked increase in plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and oxidative stress. Co-administration with resveratrol however successfully attenuated these changes, with a concomitant increase in renal antioxidants such as glutathione similar to the conventionally used angiotensin II receptor blocker, irbesartan. These data altogether suggest that targeting renal oxidative stress with resveratrol could alleviate nicotine-induced renal injury. Antioxidants may be clinically important for management of renal function in habitual smokers.",

      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease that impairs motor and cognitive functioning. A variant of the Lingo-1 genetic locus is associated with a heightened ET risk, and increased expression of cerebellar Lingo-1. Lingo-1 has been associated with neurodegenerative processes; however, neuroprotection from ET-associated degeneration can be conferred by the protein Sirt1. Sirt1 activity can be promoted by Resveratrol (Res) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3), and thus these factors may exert neuroprotective properties through a Sirt1 mechanism. As Res and VitD3 are linked to Sirt1, enhancing Sirt1 could counteract the negative effects of increased Lingo-1. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combination of Res-VitD3 in a harmaline injection model of ET would modulate Sirt1 and Lingo-1 levels. As expected, harmaline exposure (10 mg/kg/every other day; i.p.) impaired motor coordination, enhanced tremors, rearing, and cognitive dysfunction. When Res (5 mg/kg/day; i.p.) and VitD3 (0.1 mg/kg/day; i.p.) were given to adult rats (n = 8 per group) an hour before harmaline, tremor severity, rearing, and memory impairment were reduced. Individual treatment with Res and VitD3 decreased Lingo-1 gene expression levels in qPCR assays. Co-treatment with Res and VitD3 increased and decreased Sirt1 and Lingo-1 gene expression levels, respectively, and in some cases, beneficial effects on behavior were noted, which were not seen when Res or VitD3 were individually applied. Taken together, our study found that Res and VitD3 improved locomotor and cognitive deficits, modulated Sirt1 and Lingo-1. Therefore, we would recommend co-treatment of VitD3 and Res to leverage complementary effects for the management of ET symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The flow of substances between the blood and the central nervous system is precisely regulated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Its disruption due to unbalanced blood glucose levels (hyper- and hypoglycemia) occurring in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, can lead to neuroinflammation, and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most studied natural anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective compounds is resveratrol (RSV). It activates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a key metabolism regulator dependent on cell energy status. The aim of this study was to assess the astrocyte SIRT1 response to neuroinflammation and subsequent RSV treatment, depending on systemic glycemia. For this purpose, we used an optimized in vitro model of the BBB consisting of endothelial cells and astrocytes, representing microvascular and brain compartments (MC and BC), in different glycemic backgrounds. Astrocyte-secreted SIRT1 reached the highest concentration in hypo-, the lowest in normo-, and the lowest in hyperglycemic backgrounds. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation caused a substantial decrease in SIRT1 in all glycemic backgrounds, as observed earliest in hyperglycemia. RSV partially counterbalanced the effect of LPS on SIRT1 secretion, most remarkably in normoglycemia. Our results suggest that abnormal glycemic states have a worse prognosis for RSV-therapy effectiveness compared to normoglycemia.",

Resveratrol may prevent inflammation and oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 and SIRT1 signaling. We examined whether resveratrol could potentially ameliorate the cellular condition, such as renal injury due to cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by aging. Male 18-month-old C57BL/6 mice were used. Resveratrol (40 mg/kg) was administered to aged mice for 6 months. We compared histological changes, oxidative stress, and aging-related protein expression in the kidney between the resveratrol-treated group (RSV) and the control group (cont). We performed experiments using small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for Nrf2 and SIRT1 in cultured HK2 cells. Resveratrol improved renal function, proteinuria, histological changes and inflammation in aging mice. Also, expression of Nrf2-HO-1-NOQ-1 signaling and SIRT1-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling was increased in the RSV group. Transfection with Nrf2 and SIRT1 siRNA prevented resveratrol-induced anti-oxidative effect in HK2 cells in media treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Activation of the Nrf2 and SIRT1 signaling pathways ameliorated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Pharmacological targeting of Nrf2 signaling molecules may reduce the pathologic changes of aging in the kidney.",

We investigated the benefits of resveratrol against reproductive damage caused by experimental varicocele induced from peripuberty. Eighty peripubertal male rats were distributed into 4 groups: sham-control (S), varicocele (V), resveratrol (R) and varicocele treated with resveratrol (VR). Varicocele was induced through the partial ligature of the left renal vein. Resveratrol was given in a daily dose of 300 mg/kg body weight (gavage). Sperm samples were collected at 100 days of age for vitality, DNA fragmentation and chromatin protamination evaluations. OS analyses were carried out. Rats from all groups were mated with healthy primiparous females for evaluation of reproductive capacity and embryonic quality. The V group showed reduction of sperm vitality, altered chromatin protamination and sperm DNA integrity and high levels of OS. The VR group showed an improvement of oxidative status, sperm vitality, DNA integrity and chromatin structure, and an enhancement in the gestational index and embryonic quality. Therefore, we showed in this experimental model that resveratrol is a promising nutraceutical adjuvant and should be deeply studied to mitigate subfertility in varicocele.",

We hypothesized that oxidative stress might account for this decline. Human platelets were treated with or without antioxidants before storage, and samples were collected and analyzed at different time points. Platelet senescence was determined by senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay, and senescence-related platelet qualities were also analyzed. Sign of senescence became evident after Day 3 and continued to increase over time. We also found that chemical induction of platelet activation did not affect senescence level, whereas apoptosis inducers showed a stimulative effect on platelet senescence. Moreover, this effect was not prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Meanwhile, cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were found elevated during storage, and treatments with antioxidants successfully prevented this increase and also mitigated senescence levels of stored platelets. Finally, resveratrol, a natural antioxidant, was utilized as a novel storage additive to safely extend platelet shelf time. We showed that the addition of resveratrol efficiently postponed platelet senescence and ameliorated platelet storage lesion. Platelets during storage became senescent and dysfunctional over time, and we found that oxidative stress might account for this decline.

However, its combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics potentials are not reported. The study aims to assess the combined effect of RK with RSV to protect rats from carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) induced oxidative stress and NASH. The toxicant CCl4 was employed at a concentration of 1 mL/kg as a 1:1 (v/v) mixture with olive oil twice weekly for 6 weeks to induce liver toxicity. Animal treatment was followed for 2 weeks. Silymarin was used as a standard control drug to compare the hepatoprotective effect of RK and RSV. Hepatic histology, oxidative stress, MMP, reduced glutathione (GSH), plasma levels of SGOT, SGPT, and lipid profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) were measured. Anti-inflammation genes (IL-10), and fibrotic genes (TGF-β) were also examined in liver tissue. Oral administration of combined RK with RSV (50 + 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks) showed significantly more hepatoprotection by significantly decreasing elevated plasma markers and lipid profile than alone RK and RSV (100 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks). It also significantly alleviated the hepatic lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of GSH levels in the liver. RT-PCR and Immunoblotting studies confirmed that significantly upregulation of anti-inflammation genes and protein expression (MMP-9) ameliorated the disease. Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed more synergistic stability in simulated gastric-intestinal fluids (FaSSGF, FaSSIF) and rat liver microsomes (CYP-450, NADPH oxidation & glucuronidation. Moreover, coadministration of drugs augmented the relative bioavailability, V<sub>d/</sub> F (L/Kg), and MRT<sub>0-∞(</sub> h), which leads to more efficacy.

Platelet transfusion efficacy and shelf life are limited mainly by the development of platelet storage lesion (PSL). Mitigating PSL is the key to prolonging the platelet shelf life and reducing wastage. Excess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one of the main factors causing PSL. In this study, we explored a nanomedicine strategy to improve the quality and functions of platelets in storage. Resveratrol (Res), a natural plant product, is known for its antioxidative effect. However, medical applications of Res are limited due to its low water solubility and stability. Therefore, we used a resveratrol-loaded liposomal system (Res-Lipo) to better utilize the antioxidant effect of the drug. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Res-Lipo on platelet oxidative stress and alleviation of PSL during the storage time. Res-Lipo scavenged intracellular ROS and inhibited platelet apoptosis and activation during storage. Res-Lipo not only maintained mitochondrial function but also improved platelet aggregation in response to adenosine 5'-diphosphate. These results revealed that Res-Lipo ameliorated PSL and prolonged the platelet survival time in vivo. The strategy provides a potential method for extending the platelet storage time and might be considered a potential and safe additive to alleviate PSL.",

Oxidative stress markers, apoptosis-related genes, and gonadal hormones were assessed. Histological and immunohistochemical examination of uterine tissue was conducted for TGF-β 1. Caspases-3, 8, and 9 (Casp3, Casp8, Casp9) genes were assessed in uterine tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. Results revealed that BPA induced significant changes in the endometrial tissue, inflammatory cell infiltration, focal blood extravasation, increase in collagen fibers, decrease in PAS staining, and increase in TGF-β 1 immunoreactivity. BPA also induced a significant increase in oxidative stress markers; malondialdehyde (MDA), SOD, CAT, and apoptosis-related genes. BPA induced a significant change in blood levels of gonadal hormones; a significant increase in FSH and a significant decrease in estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P). Treatment with either resveratrol, MSCs, or a combination of them resulted in significant enhancement of histological findings, restoration of gonadal hormones to near-normal levels, and a significant decrease in oxidative stress markers and apoptosis genes. Combined treatment with resveratrol and MSCs demonstrated more significant therapeutic effects as regard to the studied parameters in association with rat groups treated with either MSCs or resveratrol separately.",

Resveratrol-enriched rice DJ526, which was developed as a functional crop, shows a diverse range of biological activities. Resveratrol production is measured as total resveratrol and its glycoside, piceid, which is mainly found in plant-derived resveratrol. In the present study, elicitation using yeast extract (YE), methyl jasmonate, and jasmonic acid increased resveratrol production in DJ526 rice seeds. DJ526 seeds elicited using 1 g/L (YE1) and 5 g/L yeast extract (YE5) showed enhanced resveratrol production and antioxidant activity. YE5-treated DJ526 seeds showed decreased melanin content by 46.1% and 37.0% compared with the negative control and DJ526 (non-elicitation), respectively. Both YE1 and YE5 efficiently improved the wound-healing activity by reducing the wound gap faster than in untreated cells, with a maximum rate of 60.2% at 24 h and complete closure at 48 h.

      "abstract": "Chronic stress is a major factor contributing to male infertility. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that resveratrol or dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. Our study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of resveratrol or DMF against testicular dysfunction associated with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in rats. Rats were subjected to 8 weeks of CUMS to induce depressive-like symptoms. CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviours in rats were evidenced by increased serum corticosterone levels and decreased serum and hippocampal serotonin levels as well as decreased hippocampal BDNF levels. CUMS significantly reduced sucrose preference and increased immobility time in stressed rats. Furthermore, CUMS exposure resulted in a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels and testicular expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (CYP450scc) enzyme and C-kit. CUMS significantly decreased and increased testicular expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β, respectively. CUMS also resulted in a significant increase in testicular expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-Iβ, and Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels. CUMS increased testicular MDA levels and significantly decreased testicular GSH and serum total antioxidant capacity levels. The histopathological results provided evidence for the biochemical and molecular analyses. All of these effects were significantly ameliorated by the administration of resveratrol or DMF. In conclusion, our study reveals that resveratrol or DMF exert profound testicular protective effects in CUMS rats that are mediated in part by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis leading to the upregulation of serum testosterone levels, and testicular StAR, CYP450scc, c-kit and β-catenin levels.",

To induce periodontitis, a steel ligature was placed on the cervix of the bilateral first maxillary molars. RSV (50 mg/kg/day) to the Ep-RSV group and vehicle to the Ep and control groups were gavaged. After 8 weeks, alveolar bone loss, pocket depth, gingival blood index and tooth mobility were assessed. Oxidative stress parameters, mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial ROS, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) were analysed in renal. Renal function and histology were also evaluated. Compared with the control group, the Ep group showed renal structural destruction, elevated oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial structure destruction, MMP loss, mitochondrial ROS accumulation, ATP reduction, and decreased SIRT1 and PGC-1α levels. RSV prevented these destruction (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant impairment in renal function (p > 0.05). Periodontitis induces mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tissues.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to investigate whether resveratrol affects lead-induced oxidative damage in HT-22 cells, characterizing mechanisms and strategies for preventing and treating lead-induced neurotoxicity. Various lead and resveratrol concentrations were applied to HT-22 cells over different time periods. First, we established the lead treatment (12.5, 50 and 200 μmol/L) and resveratrol (40 μmol/L) intervention model for the study. MTT was used to analyze HT-22 cell survival rate. The rates of cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were all measured by flow cytometry. Cellular oxidant (MDA) and antioxidant (SOD, GSH-Px) levels were measured with test kits. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis. Lead reduced HT-22 cell viability in a concentration/time-dependent manner. In addition, lead (200 μmol/L) decreased the protein expression of BCL2, while increasing PARP and BAX expression and apoptotic rate. Moreover, the lead-exposed group had significantly higher levels of ROS, lipid-ROS, and MDA than the control group. This was accompanied by increased MDA levels and decreased SOD, GSH-Px, and MMP levels in the lead-exposed cells. Furthermore, lead lowered SIRT1 protein expression, while increasing the levels of autophagy-related proteins, including P62, ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3 Ⅱ/Ⅰ. Resveratrol (40 μmol/L), an agonist of SIRT1, restored the effects of lead (200 μmol/L) to levelsindistinguishable from controls. Resveratrol inhibited mitochondrial damage and restored the lead-induced block of autophagic flux and oxidative stress by activating SIRT1, thereby alleviating lead-induced damage in HT-22 cells.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug known to induce bone loss. The mechanism behind doxorubicin-mediated bone loss is unclear, but oxidative stress has been suggested as a potential cause. Antioxidants that can counteract the toxic effect of doxorubicin on the bone would be helpful for the prevention of secondary osteoporosis. We used resveratrol, a natural antioxidant, and MitoTEMPO, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, to counteract doxorubicin-induced bone loss and mineralization on <i>Sparus aurata</i> larvae. Doxorubicin supplemented Microdiets increased bone deformities, decreased mineralization, and lipid peroxidation, whereas Resveratrol and MitoTEMPO supplemented microdiets improved mineralization, decreased bone deformities, and reversed the effects of doxorubicin in vivo and in vitro, using osteoblastic VSa13 cells. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis highlighted differences between groups on the distribution of skeletal anomalies and mineralization of skeleton elements. Calcium and Phosphorus content was negatively affected in the doxorubicin supplemented group. Doxorubicin reduced the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, including <i>catalase</i>, <i>glutathione peroxidase 1</i>, <i>superoxide dismutase 1</i>, and <i>hsp90</i> suggesting that ROS are central for Doxorubicin-induced bone loss. The mRNA expression of antioxidant genes was significantly increased on resveratrol alone or combined treatment. The length of intestinal villi was increased in response to antioxidants and reduced on doxorubicin. Antioxidant supplements effectively prevent bone deformities and mineralization defects, increase antioxidant response and reverse doxorubicin-induced effects on bone anomalies, mineralization, and oxidative stress. A combined treatment of doxorubicin and antioxidants was beneficial in fish larvae and showed the potential for use in preventing Doxorubicin-induced bone impairment.",

In both age groups there was a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells stimulated with RSV. It was observed that in the Elderly group there was a higher production of ROS and that the reduction from RSV was smaller compared to the other group. There was an increased activity of Superoxide Dismutase in cells exposed to RSV in the elderly group. It was observed that for the Middle Aged group, SIRT 1 and AMPK are antioxidant pathways and RSV acts via SIRT1. In the elderly, the SIRT1 remains antioxidant and RSV ceases its operation via SIRT1. RSV has an antioxidant action in both age groups, and that in aging there was a change in the cellular context characterized by the silencing of the AMPK pathway antioxidant character.",

In the present study, the preventive effects of resveratrol (RV) alone and RV-loaded silver nanoparticles (AgNPs + RV) against sepsis-induced damage were investigated and compared in a rat model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Rats were divided into four groups: Sham, CLP, RV, and AgNPs + RV. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation, presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) levels were assessed to determine the treatments' effects. AgNPs + RV treatment significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB activation, presepsin, PCT, 8-OHDG, and VEGF levels compared with the CLP group, indicating attenuation of sepsis-induced liver injury. Both RV and AgNPs + RV treatments increased SIRT1 levels, suggesting a potential role of SIRT1 activation in mediating the protective effects. In conclusion, AgNPs + RV treatment demonstrated extremely enhanced efficacy in alleviating sepsis-induced liver injury by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, potentially mediated through SIRT1 activation. In this study, the effect of AgNPs + RV on sepsis was evaluated for the first time, and these findings highlight AgNPs + RV as a promising therapeutic strategy for managing sepsis-induced liver injury, warranting further investigation.",

Here, we treated 5/6-nephrectomized (5/6Nx) rats with resveratrol and found that this treatment greatly improves renal function as evidenced by reduced proteinuria and cystatin C. Moreover, resveratrol ameliorates renal fibrosis by reducing transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Meanwhile, muscle atrophy in these 5/6Nx rats was largely attenuated by resveratrol. Immunoprecipitation revealed that SIRT1 physically interacts with FoxO1 in muscle, and this interaction was weakened in 5/6Nx rats. As a consequence, acetylated FoxO1 was increased in muscle of 5/6Nx rats. The application of resveratrol markedly reverses this trend. These data point out that SIRT1 is a key factor for linking renal disease and muscle atrophy. Indeed, both renal dysfunction and muscle atrophy were further aggravated by 5/6Nx in Sirt1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Taken together, our data indicate that SIRT1 plays a pivotal role in muscle atrophy in CKD, and FoxO1 might be a substrate of SIRT1 in this process. Furthermore, resveratrol, together with other agonists of SIRT1, may hold great therapeutic potentials for treating CKD and its related muscle atrophy.",

Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of SIRT1 activation by resveratrol and energy restriction on vascular reactivity in adults. <i>Methods</i>: A randomized trial allocated 48 healthy adults (24 women and 24 men), aged 55 to 65 years, to resveratrol supplementation or energy restriction for 30 days. Blood lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, noradrenaline, SIRT1 (circulating and gene expression), and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated vasodilation (NMD) were measured. <i>Results</i>: Both interventions increased circulating SIRT1 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Pre- and post-tests changes of plasma noradrenaline were significant for both groups (resveratrol: <i>p</i> = 0.037; energy restriction: <i>p</i> = 0.008). Baseline circulating SIRT1 was inversely correlated with noradrenaline (r = -0.508; <i>p</i> < 0.01), and post-treatment circulating SIRT1 was correlated with NMD (r = 0.433; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Circulating SIRT1 was a predictor of FMD in men (<i>p</i> = 0.045), but not in women. SIRT1 was an independent predictor of NMD (<i>p</i> = 0.026) only in the energy restriction group. <i>Conclusions</i>: Energy restriction and resveratrol increased circulating SIRT1 and reduced sympathetic activity similarly in healthy adults.

In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of resveratrol, a polyphenol with anti-oxidative activity, in N<sup>G</sup>-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) - malignantly hypertensive rats (MHR). Resveratrol significantly improves oxidative damages by modulation of antioxidant enzymes and suppression of prooxidant factors in the kidney tissue of MHR. Enhanced antioxidant defense in the kidney improves renal function and ameliorates the morphological changes in this target organ. Besides, protective properties of resveratrol are followed by the restoration of the nitrogen oxide (NO) pathway. 4) Conclusion: Antioxidant therapy with resveratrol could represent promising therapeutical approach in hypertension, especially malignant, against kidney damage.",

      "abstract": "Elevated plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) affect neutrophils function and longevity during the periparturient period in dairy cows. Previous research has shown that resveratrol (RSV) may protect cell viability from NEFA-induced damage by regulating energy metabolism. However, it is unclear whether RSV has a protective effect on palmitic acid (PA)-treated neutrophils. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular regulatory mechanism of the protective effect of RSV on neutrophils. The results showed that treatment with high concentrations of RSV (50 μM, 100 μM) maintained neutrophils activity by inhibiting neutrophils apoptosis (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that high concentrations of RSV enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to produce ATP by promoting the expression of CAV1, ACSL-1 and CPT1 (P < 0. 05) while inhibiting glycolysis by suppressing PFK1 activity (P < 0. 05) and reducing glucose transport-related protein (GLUT1/GLUT4) expression by inhibiting glucose uptake (P < 0.05). These results suggest that RSV protects neutrophils from PA-induced apoptosis by regulating energy metabolism. Our results revealed that RSV protects neutrophils from PA-induced apoptosis by shifting glucose metabolism to lipid metabolism. This study tenders to a meaningful understanding of the effects of RSV on neutrophils function in periparturient cows suffering from negative energy balance (NEB).",

Owing to the low efficiency, we aimed to fabricate an ACN nanoparticle containing resveratrol to target the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Resveratrol encapsulation was characterized using spectrophotometry, FTIR, and SEM. The cytotoxicity and antioxidant activities of compounds were evaluated by MTT, NO, FRAP, and qRT-PCR assays on MCF7 and SKBr3 cells. Our result found that the encapsulation efficiency was 87%, the particle size was 200 ± 15 nm, and the zeta potential was 31 ± 0.4 mV. The prepared RES + ACN had controlled in vitro release. RES + ACN nanoparticle showed a significantly increased cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The reduced level of NO and enhance antioxidative content in both cells, especially the MCF7, were in line with increased expression of Nrf2 and SOD as well as more apoptotic effect. Decreased growth and increased expression of Nrf2 in MCF7 compared to SKBr3 cells proved that the upregulation of Nrf2 by nanoresveratrol is likely contributed to its relationship with ER/PR signaling factors, albeit its precise mechanism is needed to be more elucidated.",

Melatonin (MEL) and resveratrol (RSV) may act as antioxidant and anti-aging compounds, but these actions in experimental animals and humans are controversial. Herein, a rat model of aging was used to study the long-term sex-related effects of MEL and RSV treatment on body mass and blood/plasma parameters of DNA damage, oxidative status (glutathione and malondialdehyde levels), and concentrations of sex hormones. Starting from the age of 3mo, for the next 9mo or 21mo male and female Wistar rats (n = 4-7 per group) were given water to drink (controls) or 0.1 % ethanol in water (vehicle), or MEL or RSV (each 10 mg/L vehicle). DNA damage in whole blood cells was tested by comet assay, whereas in plasma, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and sex hormones were determined by established methods. Using statistical analysis of data by ANOVA/Scheffe post hoc, we observed a similar sex- and aging-dependent rise of body mass in both sexes and drop of plasma testosterone in control and vehicle-treated male rats, whose pattern remained unaffected by MEL and RSV treatment. Compared with controls, all other parameters remained largely unchanged in aging and differently treated male and female rats. We concluded that the sex- and aging-related pattern of growth and various blood parameters in rats were not affected by the long-term treatment with MEL and RSV at the estimated daily doses (300-400 μg/kg b.m.) that exceed usual moderate consumption in humans.",

Epidemiological, clinical, and nutritional studies from recent years have confirmed the significant biological effects of stilbenoids, such as oxidative stress protection and the prevention of degenerative diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Stilbenoids are intensively metabolically transformed by colon microbiota, and their corresponding metabolites might show different or stronger biological activity than their parent molecules. The aim of the present study was to determine the metabolism of six stilbenoids (resveratrol, oxyresveratrol, piceatannol, thunalbene, batatasin III, and pinostilbene), mediated by colon microbiota. Stilbenoids were fermented in an in vitro faecal fermentation system using fresh faeces from five different donors as an inoculum. The samples of metabolized stilbenoids were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. Significant differences in the microbial transformation among stilbene derivatives were observed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Four stilbenoids (resveratrol, oxyresveratrol, piceatannol and thunalbene) were metabolically transformed by double bond reduction, dihydroxylation, and demethylation, while batatasin III and pinostilbene were stable under conditions simulating the colon environment. Strong inter-individual differences in speed, intensity, and pathways of metabolism were observed among the faecal samples obtained from the donors.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress inflicts mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been recognized as a key driver of intestinal diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) and its derivative pterostilbene (PTS) are natural antioxidants and exert a protective influence on intestinal health. However, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of RSV and PTS on oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intestinal injury remain unclear. The present study used porcine and cellular settings to compare the effects of RSV and PTS on mitochondrial redox homeostasis and function to alleviate oxidative stress-induced intestinal injury. Our results indicated that PTS was more potent than RSV in reducing oxidative stress, maintaining intestinal integrity, and preserving the mitochondrial function of diquat-challenged piglets. In the in vitro study, RSV and PTS protected against hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2) by facilitating mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing the activities of mitochondrial complexes. In addition, both RSV and PTS efficiently mitigated mitochondrial oxidative stress by increasing sirtuin 3 protein expression and the deacetylation of superoxide dismutase 2 and peroxiredoxin 3 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-exposed IPEC-J2 cells. Furthermore, RSV and PTS preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, which restrained the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to the cytoplasm and caspase-3 activation and further reduced apoptotic rates in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2-</sub>exposed IPEC-J2 cells. Mechanistically, depletion of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) abrogated RSV's and PTS's benefits against mitochondrial reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-exposed IPEC-J2 cells, suggesting that SIRT1 was required for RSV and PTS to protect against oxidative stress-induced intestinal injury. In conclusion, RSV and PTS improve oxidative stress-induced intestinal injury by regulating mitochondrial redox homeostasis and function via SIRT1 signaling pathway. In offering this protection, PTS is superior to RSV.",

PM has been demonstrated to cause intracellular inflammation in human keratinocytes, and is associated with various skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, eczema, and skin aging. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol with strong antioxidant properties, and its beneficial effects against skin changes due to PM remain elusive. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on PM-induced skin inflammation and attempted to deduce the molecular mechanisms underlying resveratrol's effects. We found that resveratrol inhibited PM-induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation and reactive oxygen species formation in keratinocytes. It also suppressed the subsequent cellular inflammatory response by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Consequentially, resveratrol reduced PM-induced cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 and proinflammatory cytokine expression, including that of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-9, and interleukin-8, all of which are known to be central mediators of various inflammatory conditions and aging. In conclusion, resveratrol inhibits the PM-induced inflammatory response in human keratinocytes, and we suggest that resveratrol may have potential for preventing air pollution-related skin problems.",

Kidney function tests and antioxidant activity notably improved in the treated rats (CsA + Lir/CsA + Res/CsA + Lir + Res). Moreover, both Lir and/or Res enhanced Bcl-2 levels while down-regulating the Bax levels in rats treated with CsA. Interestingly, the immune-staining for tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) was tested negative and mild positive in renal tissue of rats given Lir and/or Res while being treated with Cs A which indicated their anti-inflammatory effect that reduced the renal damage. The findings of this investigation revealed the ameliorative anti-inflammatory in addition to the antioxidant role of both liraglutide and resveratrol against the kidney damage caused due to CsA administration.",

      "abstract": "Excessive hepatic glycogen accumulation commonly impairs hepatocytes function and further produces negative effects on growth and health status of carnivorous fish. A 9-week feeding trial was conducted to explore the potential regulation of resveratrol (RSV) on high-carbohydrate-induced glycogen deposition and immune response of largemouth bass. Results showed that high dietary carbohydrate (10 % inclusion of starch) led to hepatic glycogen accumulation and post-prandial hyperglycemia compared with the diet with 5 % starch, which was both alleviated with the inclusion of RSV. The use of RSV promoted the expression of sirtuin 1, which was down-regulated by high dietary carbohydrate. Meanwhile, RSV inclusion promoted the expression of genes involved in insulin pathway and glycolysis and inhibited the expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes. Additionally, high dietary carbohydrate significantly reduced lysozyme content but increased complement C4 content, which were both reversed with RSV supplementation. Meanwhile, RSV inclusion inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but promoted anti-inflammatory cytokines expression, compared with the high carbohydrate treatment. In conclusion, RSV inclusion was beneficial in alleviating high-dietary-carbohydrate-induced glycogen accumulation and immune response in largemouth bass.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a nutritional supplement with anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigated the long-term anti-inflammatory property of resveratrol in the retinas of type 2 diabetic rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: normal control, diabetic control, resveratrol-treated normal rats and resveratrol-treated diabetic rats. Type 2 diabetes was induced by a single dose injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg; i.p.) 15 min after the administration of nicotinamide (110 mg/kg; i.p.) in 12-h fasted rats (the streptozotocin-nicotinamide type 2 diabetic model). Oral resveratrol administration (5 mg/kg per day for 4 months) significantly improved glucose tolerance, and alleviated hyperglycemia and weight loss in diabetic rats. Furthermore, resveratrol administration significantly decreased the elevated levels of nuclear factor-κB activity, and mRNA expression, tumour necrosis factor alpha level and apoptotic cells in the retinas of the diabetic rats. Furthermore, resveratrol did not significantly affect plasma insulin levels. Long-term resveratrol administration has beneficial anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model of diabetes. However, whether resveratrol exerts its effects directly or through reducing blood glucose levels requires further investigation.",
