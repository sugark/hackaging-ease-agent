      "abstract": "The objective was to determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation and microRNAs expression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 on oral hypoglycemic drugs. This was a randomized, double blinded placebo-controlled parallel group trial. The diabetic patients (n = 110) were randomly assigned either to resveratrol (n = 55) and placebo (55) groups after informed consent and given once daily resveratrol 200 mg and cellulose capsules respectively for 24 weeks. Fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, TNF- α, IL-6, hs-CRP, MDA & circulatory microRNAs were measured at start and end of 24- week intervention. Out of 110 patients recruited, 94 patients completed the study comprising of 45 in resveratrol and 46 in placebo group. The resveratrol supplementation after 24 weeks was resulted in significant reduction [mean difference (95%CI)] of plasma glucose[- 0.50(-0.94 to -0.06)], insulin[- 1.31(-2.24 to -0.38)], homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance[- 0.83(-1.37 to -0.29)], malondialdehyde[- 0.36(-0.61 to -0.11)], high sensitive-C-reactive protein[- 0.35(-0.70 to -0.01)], tumor necrosis factor-alpha[- 1.25(-1.90 to -0.61)] and interleukin-6[- 1.99(-3.29 to -0.69)]. More than two-fold down regulation in miRNA-34a, miRNA-375, miRNA-21, miRNA-192 and up regulation in miRNA-126 and miRNA-132 expression was noted in patients receiving resveratrol as compared to placebo. No side effects were reported during the trial. Resveratrol supplementation contributes in improvement of glycemic control by reducing insulin resistance. It has significant beneficial impact on chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and associated microRNA expression in diabetic patients. Thus, supplementation of resveratrol along with oral hypoglycemic agents may be useful in the reduction of diabetic associated complications.",

Because of this, natural compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic properties have been used as adjuvants. Among these compounds, resveratrol (RV) stands out, a polyphenol that has been studied in several clinical trials, the results of which are controversial. We conducted a randomized clinical trial on 97 older adults with T2D to evaluate the effect of RV on oxidative stress markers and sirtuin 1, using doses of 1000 mg/day (EG1000, <i>n</i> = 37) and 500 mg/day (EG500, <i>n</i> = 32) compared with a placebo (PG, <i>n</i> = 28). Biochemical markers, oxidative stress and sirtuin 1 levels were measured at baseline and after six months. We observed a statistically significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in total antioxidant capacity, antioxidant gap, the percentage of subjects without oxidant stress and sirtuin 1 levels in EG1000. In the PG, we observed a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in lipoperoxides, isoprostanes and C-reactive protein levels. An increase in the oxidative stress score and in the percentage of subjects with mild and moderate oxidative stress was observed too. Our findings suggest that 1000 mg/day of RV exerts a more efficient antioxidant effect than 500 mg/day.",

      "abstract": "In postmenopausal women, due to endocrine changes, there is an increase in oxidative stress (OS) that predisposes them to cardiovascular and metabolic alterations. Sixty-one percent of women in this stage require a primary therapeutic strategy to decrease OS. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol and vitamin C on OS in postmenopausal women. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Forty-six postmenopausal women with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 2.5) were included and divided into three treatment groups: group A: resveratrol, <i>n</i> = 13; group B: resveratrol + vitamin C, <i>n</i> = 15; and group C: vitamin C, <i>n</i> = 14. Between before and after the antioxidants, group B showed a decrease of 33% in lipohydroperoxides (<i>p</i> = 0.02), and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased by 26% (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), 32% (<i>p</i> = 0.0001), and 38% (<i>p</i> = 0.0001) in groups A-C, respectively. For protein damage, group B is the most representative, with a decrease of 39% (<i>p</i> = 0.0001). For total antioxidant capacity (TAC), there were significant increases of 30% and 28% in groups B and C, respectively. For HOMA-IR, there were no significant differences among the study groups. Supplementation with this combination of antioxidants significantly decreases markers of OS in postmenopausal women. In addition, it increases TAC by up to 30%.",

      "abstract": "Ageing and menopause contribute to endothelial dysfunction, causing impaired cerebral perfusion, which is in turn associated with accelerated cognitive decline. In a 14-week pilot study, we showed that supplementation with low-dose resveratrol, a phytoestrogen that can enhance endothelial function, improved cerebrovascular and cognitive functions in postmenopausal women. We sought to confirm these benefits in a larger, longer-term trial. A 24-month randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was undertaken in 125 postmenopausal women, aged 45-85 years, who took 75 mg trans-resveratrol or placebo twice-daily for 12 months and then crossover to the alternative treatment for another 12 months. We evaluated within individual differences between each treatment period in measures of cognition (primary outcome), cerebrovascular function in the middle cerebral artery (cerebral blood flow velocity: CBFV, cerebrovascular responsiveness: CVR) and cardio-metabolic markers as secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses examined effects of resveratrol by life stages. Compared to placebo, resveratrol supplementation resulted a significant 33% improvement in overall cognitive performance (Cohen's d = 0.170, P = 0.005). Women ≥65 years of age showed a relative improvement in verbal memory with resveratrol compared to those younger than 65 years. Furthermore, resveratrol improved secondary outcomes including resting mean CBFV (d = 0.275, P = 0.001), CVR to hypercapnia (d = 0.307, P = 0.027), CVR to cognitive stimuli (d = 0.259, P = 0.032), fasting insulin (d = 0.174, P = 0.025) and insulin resistance index (d = 0.102, P = 0.034). Regular supplementation with low-dose resveratrol can enhance cognition, cerebrovascular function and insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women. This may translate into a slowing of the accelerated cognitive decline due to ageing and menopause, especially in late-life women. Further studies are warranted to observe whether these cognitive benefits of resveratrol can reduce the risk of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Progressive microvascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may impair the ability of cerebral vessels to supply blood to brain regions during local metabolic demand, thereby increasing risks of dementia. Having previously demonstrated that resveratrol can enhance vasodilator function in the systemic circulation, we hypothesised that resveratrol could similarly benefit the cerebral circulation. We aimed to determine the most efficacious dose of resveratrol to improve cerebral vasodilator responsiveness (CVR) in T2DM. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover intervention, 36 dementia-free, non-insulin dependent T2DM older adults (49-78 years old) consumed single doses of synthetic trans-resveratrol (0, 75, 150, and 300 mg) at weekly intervals. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess CVR to a hypercapnic stimulus, both before and 45 min after treatment. CVR, measured bilaterally in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA), was expressed as the percentage change in mean blood flow velocity from baseline to the peak velocity attained during hypercapnia. Resveratrol consumption increased CVR in the MCA; mean within-individual changes for each dose from placebo were 13.8 ± 3.5% for 75 mg (P = 0.001), 8.9 ± 3.5% for 150 mg (P = 0.016), and 13.7 ± 3.3% for 300 mg (P < 0.001); only the 75 mg dose was efficacious in the PCA (13.2 ± 4.5%, P = 0.016). Our results provide the first clinical evidence of an acute enhancement of vasodilator responsiveness in cerebral vessels following consumption of resveratrol in this population who are known to have endothelial dysfunction and sub-clinical cognitive impairment. Importantly, maximum improvement was observed with the lowest dose used. ACTRN12614000891628 (www.anzctr.org.au).",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenol, has been reported to improve glucose metabolism and vascular function and to extend life span in animal models, but studies in humans have been inconclusive. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, we treated older glucose-intolerant adults (n = 30) with resveratrol (2-3 g/daily) or placebo, each for 6 weeks. A standard mixed-meal test was used to assess insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and secretion (C-peptide deconvolution) and vascular function by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained for gene expression using RNA-Seq analysis and to assess mitochondrial morphology. There were no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, weight, blood pressure, or lipid profile following resveratrol treatment. Fasting reactive hyperemia index improved with resveratrol (2.02 ± 0.2 vs 1.76 ± 0.02, p = .002). RNA-Seq analysis yielded 140 differentially expressed transcripts (corrected p-value ≤ .05), predominantly associated with mitochondrial genes and noncoding RNA. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed that mitochondrial dysfunction (p = 2.77 × 10-12) and oxidative phosphorylation (p = 1.41 × 10-11) were the most significantly perturbed pathways. Mitochondrial number, but not size, was increased. Resveratrol treatment of older adults with impaired glucose regulation may have beneficial effects on vascular function, but not glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. Changes in gene expression suggest effects similar to those observed with caloric restriction, which has been shown to increase life and health span in animal models, although its significance for humans is uncertain. Future human studies should address the appropriate dose range and low bioavailability of resveratrol.",

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients with diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in accordance with the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Glucose and insulin levels were measured after a 75-gram dextrose load. Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at baseline were also evaluated. Twelve patients received trans-resveratrol (500 mg) three times per day before meals for 90 days. The remaining 12 patients received placebo at the same dose. The area under the curve (AUC) values of glucose and insulin, total insulin secretion, first-phase of insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity were calculated. After resveratrol administration, there were significant differences in total weight (94.4±13.2 vs. 90.5±12.3 kg, P=0.007), body mass index (BMI) (35.6±3.2 vs. 34.3±3.0 kg/m(2), P=0.006), fat mass (41.2±7.9 vs. 38.8±6.0 kg, P=0.001), and waist circumference (WC) (109±9 vs. 105±10 cm, P=0.004). There were also significant differences in AUC of insulin (48,418±22,707 vs. 26,473±8,273 pmol/L, P=0.003) and insulinogenic index (0.48±0.22 vs. 0.28±0.08, P=0.004).

The aim of this trial was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on bone mineral density (BMD) and on calcium metabolism biomarkers in T2DM patients. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial 192 T2DM outpatients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500 mg/day (Resv500 arm), resveratrol 40 mg/day (Resv40 arm) or placebo for 6 months. BMD, bone mineral content (BMC), serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D were measured at baseline and after 6 months. At follow-up, calcium concentrations increased in all patients, while within-group variations in alkaline phosphatase were higher in both resveratrol arms, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D increased in the Resv500 arm only, without between-group differences. Whole-body BMD significantly decreased in the placebo group, while whole-body BMC decreased in both the placebo and Resv40 arms. No significant changes in BMD and BMC values occurred in the Resv500 arm. The adjusted mean differences of change from baseline were significantly different in the Resv500 arm vs placebo for whole-body BMD (0.01 vs -0.03 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.001), whole-body BMC (4.04 vs -58.8 g, p < 0.001), whole-body T-score (0.15 vs -0.26), and serum phosphorus (0.07 vs -0.01 µmol/L, p = 0.002). In subgroup analyses, in Resv500 treated-patients BMD values increased to higher levels in those with lower calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D values, and in alcohol drinkers. Supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol prevented bone density loss in patients with T2DM, in particular, in those with unfavorable conditions at baseline.",

A one-year, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled single center clinical study was carried out on overweight pregnant women. 110 patients were randomized in 3 groups to receive: Revifast® with DCI/MI (group I), DCI/MI alone (group II) or control group (group III) for 30 and 60 days. The main outcomes were to explore the lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, TG) and glucose levels, after 30 and 60 days of therapy. No difference in systolic and diastolic parameters among 3 groups during study. All blood chemistry parameters improved compared to placebo at 30 days already, but significantly to 60 days, respect placebo. By comparing the two treatment groups, group I demonstrates significantly improved lipid and glucose parameters than group II, which are at 30 to 60 days of treatment. The supplementation of Trans-resveratrol, Revifast® in addition to DCI/MI in overweight pregnant woman with an elevated fasting glucose improves glucose levels, Total Cholesterol, LDL and TG.",

Participants (n = 16) were non-diabetic, upper-body obese (BMI > 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , WHR > 0.9) men with NAFLD who were randomized (1:1) in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to either RSV or placebo (500 mg 3 times daily) for 6 months. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, dual-X-ray absorptiometry and MR imaging assessed liver fat content and body composition, respectively. <sup>14</sup> C-labeled VLDL-TG and <sup>3</sup> H-labeled glucose and palmitate tracers, in combination with indirect calorimetry and breath samples, were used to assess kinetics and substrate oxidations during basal and hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp conditions. RSV did not improve either basal or insulin-mediated VLDL-TG secretion, oxidation or clearance rates, nor did it affect palmitate or glucose turnover. Likewise, no changes in body composition or liver fat content occurred following RSV compared with placebo treatment. Therefore, RSV cannot be recommended for treatment of metabolic abnormalities in NAFLD.",

Herein, we report further analysis of study variables. MG metabolism-related variables correlated with BMI, dysglycemia, vascular inflammation, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. With tRES-HESP treatment, plasma MG correlated negatively with endothelial independent arterial dilatation (r = -0.48, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and negatively with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) quinone reductase activity (r = -0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.05)-a marker of the activation status of transcription factor Nrf2. For change from baseline of PBMC gene expression with tRES-HESP treatment, Glo1 expression correlated negatively with change in the oral glucose tolerance test area-under-the-curve plasma glucose (ΔAUGg) (r = -0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) correlated positively with ΔAUGg (r = 0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) correlated positively with change in fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.70, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and negatively with change in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.01). These correlations were not present with placebo. tRES-HESP decreased low-grade inflammation, characterized by decreased expression of CCL2, COX-2, IL-8, and RAGE. Changes in CCL2, IL-8, and RAGE were intercorrelated and all correlated positively with changes in MLXIP, MAFF, MAFG, NCF1, and FTH1, and negatively with changes in HMOX1 and TKT; changes in IL-8 also correlated positively with change in COX-2. Total urinary excretion of tRES and HESP metabolites were strongly correlated. These findings suggest tRES-HESP counters MG accumulation and protein glycation, decreasing activation of the unfolded protein response and expression of TXNIP and TNFα, producing reversal of insulin resistance. tRES-HESP is suitable for further evaluation for treatment of insulin resistance and related disorders.",

The aims of this study was to study the impact of resveratrol supplementation in adjunct with non-surgical periodontal therapy on inflammatory, antioxidant, and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes with periodontal disease. In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into two intervention and control groups receiving either resveratrol supplements or placebo for 4 weeks. Serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) as the main index of periodontal marker were measured pre-intervention and post-intervention. In the intervention group, the mean serum level of IL6 was reduced significantly (P = 0.039) post-intervention (2.19 ± 1.09 and 1.58 ± 1.06). No significant differences were seen in the mean levels of IL6, TNFα, TAC and CAL between two groups post-intervention. It is suggested that daily consumption of resveratrol supplement may not change TNFα, TAC and CAL, but it would be beneficial in reducing serum levels of IL6. Therefore, further studies are suggested to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation along with NST on periodontal status.",

      "abstract": "In non-athletes, insulin sensitivity correlates negatively with intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content. In athletes, however, a pattern of benign IMCL storage exists, which is characterized by lipid storage in type I muscle fibres, in small and numerous lipid droplets (LDs) preferable coated with PLIN5, without affecting insulin sensitivity. Administration of resveratrol has been promoted for its beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. We observed that 30 days of oral resveratrol administration (150 mg/day) in metabolically compromised individuals showed a 33% increase in IMCL (placebo vs. resveratrol; 0.86 ± 0.090 AU vs. 1.14 ± 0.11 AU, p = 0.003) without impeding insulin sensitivity. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine if a resveratrol-mediated increase in IMCL content, in metabolically compromised individuals, changes the LD phenotype towards the phenotype we previously observed in athletes. For this, we studied IMCL, LD number, LD size, subcellular distribution and PLIN5 coating in different fibre types using high-resolution confocal microscopy. As proof of concept, we observed a 2.3-fold increase (p = 0.038) in lipid accumulation after 48 h of resveratrol incubation in cultured human primary muscle cells. In vivo analysis showed that resveratrol-induced increase in IMCL is predominantly in type I muscle fibres (placebo vs. resveratrol; 0.97 ± 0.16% vs. 1.26 ± 0.09%; p = 0.030) in both the subsarcolemmal (p = 0.016) and intermyofibrillar region (p = 0.026) and particularly in PLIN5-coated LDs (p = 0.024). These data indicate that administration of resveratrol augments IMCL content in metabolically compromised individuals towards a LD phenotype that mimics an 'athlete like phenotype'.",

This randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the tertiary care institute of the NUMS, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A total of 82 adult MetS patients were enrolled and randomly grouped into the TRM group (n = 41) and the Placebo group (n = 41). Patients in the TRM group were given 400 mg capsules (δ-tocotrienol 250 mg; Resveratrol 150 mg) and placebo received (cellulose 400 mg capsule) twice daily for 24 weeks. The TRM supplementation revealed a significant (p < 0.001) upregulation of 3.05-fold in miRNA-130b-5p and 2.45-fold in miRNA-221-5p while miRNA-122-5p was downregulated by 2.22-fold as compared to placebo. No significant difference was observed in miRNA-15b-5p and miRNA-376b-5p. Moreover, TRM group participants with reverted MetS had significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated miRNA-130b-5p, miRNA-221-5p, and downregulated miRNA-122-5p relative to non-reverted patients with MetS. Daily TRM supplementation may improve metabolic syndrome by upregulated miR-130b-5p, which is involved in central obesity and inflammation, as well as miR-221-5p, which is involved in insulin resistance. Additionally, TRM downregulate of miRNA 122, which improved dyslipidemia.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on metabolism and the function of blood platelets under static and in in vitro flow conditions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Blood obtained from 8 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with type 2 diabetes was incubated with resveratrol and perfused over collagen-coated capillaries. Isolated blood platelets were incubated with resveratrol and activated by collagen to assess platelet function, metabolism, ATP release, TXA<sub>2</sub> production, lipid peroxidation, and gluthatione content. In the type 2 diabetes group, plasma glucose and fructosamine concentrations were significantly higher than in the healthy group. In in vitro studies, collagen-induced thrombi formation in the blood of diabetic patients was 33% higher than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced thrombi by over 50% in the blood of healthy and diabetic patients. TXA<sub>2</sub> production was 47% higher in diabetic platelets than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced TXA<sub>2</sub> release by 38% in healthy platelets and by 79% in diabetic platelets. Resveratrol also reduced the activities of enzymes responsible for glycolysis and oxidative metabolism in the platelets of both groups. These data indicate that the resveratrol-induced inhibition of platelet metabolism and TXA<sub>2</sub> release may lead to a reduction of platelet function and thrombus formation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, resveratrol may be beneficial to prevent vascular complications as a future complementary treatment in aspirin-resistant diabetic patients.",

Its role on pentraxin 3 (PTX3) concentrations, a human acute phase protein, has never been evaluated. Our aim was to determine whether a two-dosage resveratrol supplementation (500 and 40 mg/day) has an impact on PTX3 values in T2DM patients from a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Variations in total antioxidant status (TAS) were evaluated too. A total of 192 T2DM patients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500 mg/day (Resv 500 arm), resveratrol 40 mg/day (Resv 40 arm) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and at the trial end, PTX3 and TAS values were determined. A dose-dependent increase in PTX3 concentrations of 4.7% (Resv 40 arm) and 26.3% (Resv 500 arm), and 8.0% reduction after placebo were found. Adjusted mean differences of change versus placebo were 0.16 (95% CI 0.01-0.32) and 0.25 (0.09-0.42) in the Resv 40 and Resv 500 arms, respectively. At subgroup analyses, lower diabetes duration, aspirin, alcohol use, younger age, female gender, smoking (Resv 500 arm) and female gender and aspirin use (Resv 40 arm) were associated with higher PTX3 increments. A dose-dependent increment in TAS values in the resveratrol arms (1.4 and 6.4% for Resv 40 and Resv 500, respectively), and a reduction in placebo arm (-8.9%) were observed. Adjusted mean differences of change were 28.5 (95% CI 10.1-46.8) and 44.8 (25.4-64.1) in the Resv 40 and Resv 500 arms, respectively. Resveratrol supplementation increased PTX3 and TAS levels in a dose-dependent manner in T2DM patients. At present, potential clinical implications of these results remain unclear. CLINICALTRIALS.

We herein aim to evaluate whether an increase in SIRT-1 expression affects histone 3 acetylation at the 56 lysine residue (H3K56ac) in T2DM patients randomly selected to receive either resveratrol (40 mg or 500 mg) or a placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome is changes in the H3K56ac level by variation in SIRT-1 expression and the secondary outcome is the evidence of association between SIRT-1 level, antioxidant markers (TAS), and metabolic variables. At baseline, peripheral blood mononuclear cell H3K56ac values among the SIRT-1 tertiles did not differ. At trial end, SIRT-1 levels were significantly higher in patients receiving 500 mg resveratrol. At follow-up, patients were divided into tertiles of delta (trial end minus baseline) SIRT-1 value. Significant reductions in H3K56ac and body fat percentage were found in the highest tertile as were increased TAS levels. A multiple logistic regression model showed that the highest delta SIRT-1 tertile was inversely associated with variations in H3K56ac (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.99), TAS (OR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02), and body fat percentage (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.96). We provide new knowledge on H3K56ac and SIRT-1 association in T2DM. These data suggest that boosting SIRT-1 expression/activation may impact redox homeostasis in these patients.

In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 71 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1,000 mg of trans-resveratrol or placebo (methyl cellulose) for 8 weeks. Expression levels of genes of interest, and serum levels of sCD163 and sTWEAK were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Resveratrol supplementation significantly increased mRNA expression levels of p53 and p21 genes, compared with the placebo group (fold change of p53 = 1.29, p = .04; fold change of p21 = 1.46, p = .006). However, no significant effect on expression levels of PPARα and p16 genes was observed after supplementation. In addition, resveratrol significantly reduced serum levels of sCD163/sTWEAK ratio compared with the placebo group (p = .003). Resveratrol supplementation resulted in significant changes in p53 and p21 genes expression, while serum levels of sCD163/sTWEAK ratio also improved in the resveratrol group, without any significant change in adjusted sCD163 levels. More research is needed to confirm the beneficial effects of resveratrol for patients with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are prone to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We aimed to investigate whether the resveratrol supplementation improves novel hepatic and cardiovascular indices in these patients. We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial for 8 weeks. Seventy-six patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg/day resveratrol or placebo. Levels of lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), Castelli risk index I (CRI-I), CRI-II and atherogenic coefficient (AC) were measured at the beginning and after intervention. A total of 71 participants completed the trial. After adjusting for confounding factors including medications, diabetes duration, energy intake and physical activity, no significant difference was found between the intervention group and the control group in LAP (mean change: - 2.46 ± 23.3 vs. 1.43 ± 14.3; P = 0.43), VAI (mean change: - 0.25 ± 1.1 vs. - 0.02 ± 0.6; P = 0.47), CRI-I (mean change: - 0.25 ± 0.9 vs. - 0.09 ± 0.5; P = 0.79), CRI-II (mean change: - 0.23 ± 0.7 vs. - 0.06 ± 0.6; P = 0.38) and AC (mean change: - 0.25 ± 0.9 vs. - 0.09 ± 0.5; P = 0.79). Resveratrol supplementation had no effect on hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular indices. Further clinical trials, especially among subjects with dyslipidemia are needed to reach a firm conclusion. In addition, taking all medications should be controlled in future studies. Trial registration The protocol was registered on 29/12/2017 at the Iranian clinical trials website (IRCT20171118037528N1) with URL: https://en.irct.ir/trial/27734 .",

Although in vitro and animal studies have shown that resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory effects, clinical trials addressing these effects in patients with T2D are limited. Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that supplementation of resveratrol might improve inflammatory markers in patients with T2D in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 45 T2D patients were supplemented with either of 800 mg/d resveratrol or placebo capsules for 8 weeks. Percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin [IL] 1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), the expression levels of genes involved in the inflammatory responses (toll-like receptor 2, toll-like receptor 4, and nuclear factor κB), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine (tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and IL-6) secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and metabolic and anthropometric parameters were assessed at both the baseline level and the end of the study. Compared with the placebo group, we could not detect any significant difference in the percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes, lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine secretion, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of inflammatory genes in resveratrol group. Moreover, we did not find any significant change in the metabolic and anthropometric parameters except for a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose and blood pressure. In conclusion, 8-week supplementation of resveratrol reduces blood glucose level in patients with T2D without improving their inflammatory markers.",

In vitro and animal studies have shown that resveratrol exerts an antioxidant effect, but clinical trials addressing this effect in patients with T2D are limited. The aim of this study was to determine whether resveratrol supplementation affects oxidative stress markers in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. A total of 48 patients with T2D randomly were assigned to receive 800 mg/day resveratrol or placebo for 2 months. Plasma total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde concentration, protein carbonyl and total thiol contents, intracellular superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>·) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in PBMCs, the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress responses (Nrf2, SOD, Cat, HO-1, RAGE, NOS) in PBMCs, and metabolic and anthropometric parameters were measured at the baseline and at the trial end. Compared with the placebo group, resveratrol reduced plasma protein carbonyl content and PBMCs O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>· level and significantly increased plasma total antioxidant capacity and total thiol content. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 and SOD was significantly increased after resveratrol consumption. Resveratrol had no significant effects on the metabolic and anthropometric parameters except for a significant reduction in weight, BMI, and blood pressure levels. Resveratrol was well tolerated, and no serious adverse event was occurred. Our study demonstrated that 8 weeks of supplementation with 800 mg/day resveratrol has an antioxidant effect in the blood and PBMCs of patients with T2D.

In this double-blinded randomized trial, 76 patients with T2D were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to consume 1,000 mg resveratrol or placebo capsules (methylcellulose) per day, for 8 weeks. Serum levels of ADMA and PON1 enzyme activity were measured at the beginning and end of the intervention using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In total, 71 participants completed the study. Our results showed that resveratrol significantly decreased serum levels of ADMA (-0.16 ± 0.11, p < .001) and improved PON1 enzyme activity (15.39 ± 13.99, p < .001) compared with placebo, after adjusting for confounding factors (age, sex, and baseline body mass index). Our findings suggest that 8-week resveratrol supplementation may produce beneficial effects on serum levels of ADMA and PON1 enzyme activity in patients with T2DM. However, further research is needed to confirm the veracity of these results.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol has been reported to have potent anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal studies. However, there are few interventional studies in human patients with atherosclerogenic diseases. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) reflects arterial stiffness and is a clinical surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol on arterial stiffness assessed by CAVI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 50 patients with T2DM received supplement of a 100mg resveratrol tablet (total resveratrol: oligo-stilbene 27.97 mg/100 mg/day) or placebo daily for 12 weeks. CAVI was assessed at baseline and the end of study. Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), glucose and lipid metabolic parameters, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs; an oxidative stress marker) were also measured.Resveratrol supplementation decreased systolic BP (-5.5 ± 13.0 mmHg), d-ROMs (-25.6 ± 41.8 U.CARR), and CAVI (-0.4 ± 0.7) significantly (P < 0.05) and decreased BW (-0.8 ± 2.1 kg, P = 0.083) and body mass index (-0.5 ± 0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.092) slightly compared to baseline, while there were no significant changes in the placebo group. Decreases in CAVI and d-ROMs were significantly greater in the resveratrol group than in the placebo group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified resveratrol supplementation as an independent predictor for a CAVI decrease of more than 0.5.In conclusion, 12-week resveratrol supplementation may improve arterial stiffness and reduce oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. Resveratrol may be beneficial in preventing the development of atherosclerosis induced by diabetes. However, a large-scale cohort study is required to validate the present findings.",

Its benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are controversial. Our aims were to determine whether resveratrol supplementation at two different dosages (500 and 40mg/day) for 6 months i) reduced the concentrations of C-reactive-protein (CRP) and ii) ameliorated the metabolic pattern of T2DM patients. In the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 192 T2DM patients were randomized to receive resveratrol 500mg/day (Resv500arm), resveratrol 40mg/day (Resv40arm) or placebo for 6-months. At baseline and at the trial end, CRP values, anthropometric, metabolic and liver parameters were determined. No serious adverse event occurred. A dose-dependent, though not significant, CRP decrease of 5.6% (Resv40arm) and 15.9% (Resv500arm) was observed vs placebo. We failed to detect significant differences in weight, BMI, waist circumference, and values of arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids, liver transaminases, uric acid, adiponectin, interleukin-6, in both the Resv500 and Resv40 arms vs placebo. Total cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased in the Resv500arm. Subgroup analyses revealed that lower diabetes duration (in both Resv500 and Resv40arms), and, in the Resv500arm, younger age, aspirin use and being a smoker were associated with a significantly higher CRP reduction vs placebo. The supplementations with 40mg/day or 500mg/day resveratrol did neither reduce CRP concentrations, nor improve the metabolic pattern of T2DM patients.",

A total of 71 overweight patients with T2DM (body mass index ranged 25-30) were randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg/day trans-resveratrol or placebo (methyl cellulose) for 8 weeks. Anthropometric indices and biochemical indices including lipid and glycemic profile were measured before and after the intervention. In adjusted model (age, sex, and baseline body mass index), resveratrol decreased fasting blood sugar (-7.97±13.6 mg/dL, p=0.05) and increased high density lipoprotein (3.62±8.75 mg/dL, p=0.01) levels compared with placebo. Moreover, the mean difference in insulin levels reached significance (-0.97±1.91, μIU/mL, p= 0.02). However, no significant differences were observed for anthropometric measures. It was found that 8-week resveratrol supplementation produced useful effects on some cardio-metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 56 patients having T2DM and CHD. The patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 500 mg resveratrol per day (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28) for 4 weeks. Resveratrol reduced fasting glucose (β-10.04 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI, -18.23, -1.86; P = 0.01), insulin (β-1.09 μIU mL<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI, -1.93, -0.24; P = 0.01) and insulin resistance (β-0.48; 95% CI, -0.76, -0.21; P = 0.001) and significantly increased insulin sensitivity (β 0.006; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.01; P = 0.02) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol also significantly increased HDL-cholesterol levels (β 3.38 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI, 1.72, 5.05; P < 0.001) and significantly decreased the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio (β-0.36; 95% CI, -0.59, -0.13; P = 0.002) when compared with the placebo. Additionally, resveratrol caused a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (β 58.88 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI, 17.33, 100.44; P = 0.006) and a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (β-0.21 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>; 95% CI, -0.41, -0.005; P = 0.04) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol upregulated PPAR-γ (P = 0.01) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) (P = 0.01) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM patients with CHD. Resveratrol supplementation did not have any effect on inflammatory markers. Four-week supplementation of resveratrol in patients with T2DM and CHD had beneficial effects on glycemic control, HDL-cholesterol levels, the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, TAC and MDA levels. Resveratrol also upregulated PPAR-γ and SIRT1 in the PBMCs of T2DM patients with CHD.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that resveratrol (RES) exerts anti-inflammatory effects but human trials evidencing these effects in vivo are limited. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms triggered in humans following the oral intake of RES are not yet understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) associated to the one-year daily intake of a RES enriched (8 mg) grape extract (GE-RES) in hypertensive male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We used microarrays and RT-PCR to analyze expression changes in genes and microRNAs (miRs) involved in the inflammatory response modulated by the consumption of GE-RES in comparison to a placebo and GE lacking RES. We also examined the changes in several serobiochemical variables, inflammatory and fibrinolytic markers. Our results showed that supplementation with GE or GE-RES did not affect body weight, blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c or lipids, beyond the values regulated by gold standard medication in these patients. We did not find either any significant change on serum inflammatory markers except for a significant reduction of ALP and IL-6 levels. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3, IL-1β and TNF-α was significantly reduced and that of the transcriptional repressor LRRFIP-1 increased in PBMCs from patients taking the GE-RES extract. Also, a group of miRs involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response: miR-21, miR-181b, miR-663, miR-30c2, miR-155 and miR-34a were found to be highly correlated and altered in the group consuming the GE-RES for 12 months. Our results provide preliminary evidence that long-term supplementation with a grape extract containing RES downregulates the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines with the involvement of inflammation-related miRs in circulating immune cells of T2DM hypertensive medicated patients and support a beneficial immunomodulatory effect in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: fat tissue is an organ with endocrine function, where the hormone leptin (LEP) is identified. This peptide regulates appetite, the immune system, vascular functions and insulin sensitivity. Zinc (Zn) and resveratrol (RES) have potential effects on adipose tissue. Objective: to know if the combined administration of Zn and RES has any effect on blood leptin quantification in obese people. Methods: longitudinal experimental study, controlled clinical trial design, randomized, double blind. Randomized formation of four groups: T1 (Zn 50 mg), T2 (control), T3 (RES 500 mg), T4 (Zn 50 mg and RES 500 mg) with a supplementation period of 60 days. Blood samples were taken and glucose (GLU), leptin (LEP) and lipids (HDL, LDL, TGL) were quantified before and after exposure to the study elements. Results: age 34 (± 7) years. In T-tests, significance in GLU (p = 0.04) and LEP (p = 0.055). By exposure groups: GLU at T1 (p = 0.03) and T2 (p = 0.031); at LEP at T4 (p = 0.024). Lipids by groups: HDL at T3 (p = 0.039) and T4 (p = 0.014). ANOVA, HDL (p = 0.06). Pearson, HDL (p = 0.07) and LDL (p = 0.09). Conclusion: zinc and resveratrol showed promise as agents in modulating leptin and glucose signaling, confirming that they work in a proportional manner and provide benefits for cardiac health, but more exposure time is needed to see if they impact energy balance homeostasis.",

We hypothesized that increasing expression of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1)-an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of reactive metabolite and glycating agent methylglyoxal-may improve metabolic and vascular health. Dietary bioactive compounds were screened for Glo1 inducer activity in a functional reporter assay, hits were confirmed in cell culture, and an optimized Glo1 inducer formulation was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial in 29 overweight and obese subjects. We found trans-resveratrol (tRES) and hesperetin (HESP), at concentrations achieved clinically, synergized to increase Glo1 expression. In highly overweight subjects (BMI >27.5 kg/m(2)), tRES-HESP coformulation increased expression and activity of Glo1 (27%, P < 0.05) and decreased plasma methylglyoxal (-37%, P < 0.05) and total body methylglyoxal-protein glycation (-14%, P < 0.01). It decreased fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (-5%, P < 0.01, and -8%, P < 0.03, respectively), increased oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (42 mL ⋅ min(-1) ⋅ m(-2), P < 0.02), and improved arterial dilatation Δbrachial artery flow-mediated dilatation/Δdilation response to glyceryl nitrate (95% CI 0.13-2.11). In all subjects, it decreased vascular inflammation marker soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (-10%, P < 0.01). In previous clinical evaluations, tRES and HESP individually were ineffective. tRES-HESP coformulation could be a suitable treatment for improved metabolic and vascular health in overweight and obese populations.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol possesses several beneficial metabolic effects in rodents, while the effects of resveratrol in humans remain unclear. Therefore, we performed a non-targeted comprehensive metabolomic analysis on blood, urine, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome randomized to either resveratrol or placebo treatment for four months. Changes in steroid hormones across all four matrices were the most pronounced changes observed. Resveratrol treatment reduced sulfated androgen precursors in blood, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue, and increased these metabolites in urine. Furthermore, markers of muscle turnover were increased and lipid metabolism was affected, with increased intracellular glycerol and accumulation of long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated (n3 and n6) free fatty acids in resveratrol-treated men. Finally, urinary derivatives of aromatic amino acids, which mainly reflect the composition of the gut microbiota, were altered upon resveratrol treatment. In conclusion, the non-targeted metabolomics approach applied to four different matrices provided evidence of subtle but robust effects on several metabolic pathways following resveratrol treatment for four months in men with metabolic syndrome-effects that, for the most part, would not have been detected by routine analyses. The affected pathways should be the focus of future clinical trials on resveratrol's effects, and perhaps particularly the areas of steroid metabolism and the gut microbiome.",

The polyphenol resveratrol prevents the development of experimental NAFLD through modulation of cellular pathways involved in calorie restriction. We aimed to test the hypothesis that resveratrol alleviates NAFLD in a randomised, clinical trial. A total of 28 overweight patients with transaminasemia and histological NAFLD were randomised 1:1 to placebo or resveratrol 1.5 g daily for 6 months. Twenty-six participants completed the trial and underwent repeated clinical investigation, blood work, MR spectroscopy; and 19 participants agreed to a repeat liver biopsy. Resveratrol treatment was generally not superior to placebo in improving plasma markers of liver injury (primary outcome: alanine transaminase, p = 0.51). Resveratrol-treated patients showed a 3.8% decrease in liver lipid content (p = 0.03), with no difference between the two treatment arms (p = 0.38) and no improvement of histological features. Resveratrol treatment was not associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity or markers of the metabolic syndrome, except for a transient decrease in systolic BP. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed no major changes in expression profile. Also, we report a serious adverse event in a patient who developed fever and bicytopenia. In this placebo-controlled, high-dose and long-term study, resveratrol treatment had no consistent therapeutic effect in alleviating clinical or histological NAFLD, though there may be a small ameliorating effect on liver function tests and liver fat accumulation.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on metabolic health in humans. This randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 39 subjects, including 10 overweight men and 9 overweight women (BMI ≥ 25), as well as 10 non-overweight men and 10 non-overweight women (BMI < 25). Subjects received piceatannol (20 mg/day) or placebo capsules for eight weeks in a random order. The primary outcome was the effect of piceatannol on glucose-metabolism, including insulin sensitivity. The secondary outcomes were the effects on other parameters, including blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), endothelial function, lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, mood status, and Sirt1 and phospho-AMP-activated kinase (p-AMPK) expression in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). Supplementation with piceatannol in overweight men reduced serum insulin levels, HOMA-IR, BP and HR. Other groups, including non-overweight men, as well as overweight and non-overweight women, showed no beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, BP and HR. Furthermore, piceatannol is not associated with other data, including body weight (BW), body composition, endothelial function, lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, mood status, and Sirt1/p-AMPK expression in PBMNCs. In conclusion, supplementation with piceatannol can improve metabolic health, including insulin sensitivity, BP and HR, in overweight men.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of resveratrol in decreasing hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) by a preliminary investigation designed as an exploratory clinical trial. Thirteen patients with T1D from both the sexes participated in this trial. All patients received resveratrol in 500 mg capsules, twice daily for 60 days. Bodyweight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model of assessment for β-cell function (HOMA-β), and markers of liver and kidney damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress were measured before the intervention, at 30 days and at 60 days. Resveratrol supplementation for 60 days significantly decreased FBS and HbA1c in comparison with the baseline values. Resveratrol treatment also resulted in a decrease in the level of a marker for oxidative stress, malondialdehyde, and an increase in total antioxidant capacity in T1D patients. Insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and markers of liver and kidney function and inflammation were not significantly affected by resveratrol treatment. Overall, the results showed that 60 days of resveratrol supplementation exerted strong antidiabetic and antioxidant effects in patients with T1D.",

In this double-blind clinical trial study, 43 patients with diabetes with chronic periodontitis were participated. Subjects were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention and control groups received either 480 mg/day of resveratrol or placebo capsules (two pills) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), TGs, and pocket depth were measured in all subjects' pre-intervention and post-intervention. The mean serum levels of fasting insulin and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control group (10.42 ± 0.28 and 10.92 ± 0.9; 3.66 ± 0.97 and 4.49 ± 1.56, respectively). There was a significant difference in the mean pocket depth between intervention and control groups (2.35 ± 0.6 and 3.38 ± 0.5, respectively) following intervention. No significant differences were observed in the mean levels of fasting blood glucose and TGs between two groups' post-intervention. It is recommended that resveratrol supplementation may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy along with non-surgical periodontal treatment in insulin resistance and improving periodontal status among patients with diabetes with periodontal disease.

The beneficial effects of resveratrol on metabolic disorders have been shown previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with NAFLD. In this randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, fifty NAFLD patients were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol capsule or a placebo capsule for 12 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow an energy-balanced diet and physical activity recommendations. resveratrol supplementation reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic steatosis significantly more than placebo (P0·05). There were no significant changes in blood pressure, insulin resistance markers and TAG in either group (P>0·05). Our data have shown that 12-week supplementation of 500 mg resveratrol does not have any beneficial effect on anthropometric measurements, insulin resistance markers, lipid profile and blood pressure; however, it reduced ALT and hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD.",

Recent evidence has indicated that dietary polyphenols may modulate mitochondrial function, substrate metabolism and energy expenditure in humans. The present study investigated the effects of short-term supplementation of two combinations of polyphenols on energy expenditure (EE) and substrate metabolism in overweight subjects. Eighteen healthy overweight volunteers (9 women, 9 men; age 35±2.5 years; body mass index 28.9±0.4 kg m(-2)) participated in a randomized, double-blind cross-over trial. Combinations of epigallocatechin-gallate (E, 282 mg day(-1))+resveratrol (R, 200 mg day(-1)) and E+R+80 mg day(-1) soy isoflavones (S) or placebo capsules (PLA) were supplemented twice daily for a period of 3 days. On day 3, circulating metabolite concentrations, EE and substrate oxidation (using indirect calorimetry) were measured during fasting and postprandial conditions for 6 h (high-fat-mixed meal (2.6 MJ, 61.2 E% fat)). Short-term supplementation of E+R increased resting EE (E+R vs PLA: 5.45±0.24 vs 5.23±0.25 kJ min(-1), P=0.039), whereas both E+R (699±18 kJ 120 min(-1) vs 676±20 kJ 120 min(-1), P=0.028) and E+R+S (704±18 kJ 120 min(-1) vs 676±20 kJ 120 min(-1), P=0.014) increased 2-4 h-postprandial EE compared with PLA. Metabolic flexibility, calculated as the postprandial increase to the highest respiratory quotient achieved, tended to be improved by E+R compared with PLA and E+R+S only in men (E+R vs PLA: 0.11±0.02 vs 0.06±0.02, P=0.059; E+R+S: 0.03±0.02, P=0.009). E+R+S significantly increased fasting plasma free fatty acid (P=0.064) and glycerol (P=0.021) concentrations compared with PLA. We demonstrated for the first time that combined E+R supplementation for 3 days significantly increased fasting and postprandial EE, which was accompanied by improved metabolic flexibility in men but not in women. Addition of soy isoflavones partially reversed these effects possibly due to their higher lipolytic potential. The present findings may imply that long-term supplementation of these dosages of epigallocatechin-gallate combined with resveratrol may improve metabolic health and body weight regulation.",

      "abstract": "People with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have increased oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial activity, and poor walking performance. NAD+ reduces oxidative stress and is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial respiration. Oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) increases bioavailability of NAD+ in humans. Among 90 people with PAD, this randomized double-blind clinical trial assessed whether 6-months of NR, with and without resveratrol, improves 6-min walk distance, compared to placebo, at 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo, NR significantly improved 6-min walk (+7.0 vs. -10.6 meters, between group difference: +17.6 (90% CI: + 1.8,+∞). Among participants who took at least 75% of study pills, compared to placebo, NR improved 6-min walk by 31.0 meters and NR + resveratrol improved 6-min walk by 26.9 meters. In this work, NR meaningfully improved 6-min walk, and resveratrol did not add benefit to NR alone in PAD. A larger clinical trial to confirm these findings is needed.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RES supplementation on oxidative stress in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN). <b>Methods</b>: This randomized, single-center, open-label study involved 72 adult patients, with 40 completing the intervention. Participants in the intervention group received 400 mg of liposomal RES daily for 12 weeks alongside HEN, while the control group received HEN only. Body composition and oxidative stress markers-including total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH)-were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. <b>Results</b>: Significant increases in TAC and SOD activity were observed in both groups. GPx activity increased significantly only in the RES group. MDA levels rose in both groups but were more pronounced in the RES group. GSH levels showed no significant changes. Phase angle (PhA) increased significantly in the RES group, while no significant change was observed in the control group. <b>Conclusions</b>: RES supplementation may enhance antioxidant defenses, as evidenced by increased GPx activity and improvements in TAC and SOD levels, supporting oxidative balance in patients with HNC receiving HEN. The higher MDA levels in the RES group may reflect RES's dual antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities. Additionally, the observed increase in PhA suggests potential cellular health benefits. These findings highlight the potential of RES as a complementary antioxidant intervention in clinical oncology, warranting further investigation to clarify its therapeutic effects on oxidative stress and cellular health in cancer care.",

Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of SIRT1 activation by resveratrol and energy restriction on vascular reactivity in adults. <i>Methods</i>: A randomized trial allocated 48 healthy adults (24 women and 24 men), aged 55 to 65 years, to resveratrol supplementation or energy restriction for 30 days. Blood lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, noradrenaline, SIRT1 (circulating and gene expression), and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated vasodilation (NMD) were measured. <i>Results</i>: Both interventions increased circulating SIRT1 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Pre- and post-tests changes of plasma noradrenaline were significant for both groups (resveratrol: <i>p</i> = 0.037; energy restriction: <i>p</i> = 0.008). Baseline circulating SIRT1 was inversely correlated with noradrenaline (r = -0.508; <i>p</i> < 0.01), and post-treatment circulating SIRT1 was correlated with NMD (r = 0.433; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Circulating SIRT1 was a predictor of FMD in men (<i>p</i> = 0.045), but not in women. SIRT1 was an independent predictor of NMD (<i>p</i> = 0.026) only in the energy restriction group. <i>Conclusions</i>: Energy restriction and resveratrol increased circulating SIRT1 and reduced sympathetic activity similarly in healthy adults. SIRT1 was independently associated with NMD only in the energy restriction group.",
